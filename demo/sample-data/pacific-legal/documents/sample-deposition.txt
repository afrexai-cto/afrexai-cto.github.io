BY MS. LANGFORD:

Q.  Please state your name and title for the record.
A.  Kevin Barnes. I'm a senior claims adjuster with State Farm
    Insurance Company, assigned to the Portland regional office.

Q.  How long have you held that position?
A.  Approximately eleven years. I started with State Farm in 2015.

Q.  Mr. Barnes, are you familiar with claim number SF-2025-78432,
    the claim filed by Rosa Martinez?
A.  Yes, I was the primary adjuster assigned to that claim.

Q.  When was the claim first reported?
A.  It was reported on August 3, 2025, the same day as the
    accident.

Q.  And what was the initial reserve set on the claim?
A.  The initial reserve was set at $25,000.

MR. REED: Objection, work product.

MS. LANGFORD: The reserve amount is discoverable, counsel.

Q.  You may answer, Mr. Barnes.
A.  As I said, the initial reserve was $25,000. It was later
    adjusted to $15,000 after our investigation.

Q.  What prompted the reduction in the reserve amount?
A.  Our investigation indicated that Ms. Martinez may have had
    a pre-existing condition affecting the claimed injuries.

Q.  Did you obtain Ms. Martinez's medical records?
A.  Yes, we obtained records from her primary care physician
    and the emergency room visit on the date of the accident.

Q.  Did you consult with a medical professional in making your
    coverage determination?
A.  We used our standard internal review process.

Q.  That's not what I asked. Did a physician review the claim?
A.  Not a physician specifically, no.

MS. LANGFORD: Let the record reflect the witness paused before
answering. No further questions at this time.

(Deposition adjourned at 3:47 PM)
