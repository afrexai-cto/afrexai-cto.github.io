INTRODUCTION

Defendant Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon
("TriMet") respectfully moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiff's
Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

Plaintiff Marcus Johnson alleges that on or about September 14,
2025, he sustained injuries while boarding a TriMet MAX Light Rail
vehicle at the Pioneer Courthouse Square station. Plaintiff claims
the train operator negligently closed the doors while Plaintiff
was in the process of boarding.

ARGUMENT

I. STANDARD OF REVIEW

To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint
must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state
a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. Ashcroft v.
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).

II. PLAINTIFF FAILS TO STATE A NEGLIGENCE CLAIM

Plaintiff's Complaint contains only conclusory allegations that
TriMet was "negligent" without identifying the specific duty
breached or how TriMet's conduct fell below the applicable
standard of care. Bare assertions of negligence, without more,
are insufficient to state a plausible claim.

III. PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE OREGON TORT CLAIMS ACT

TriMet, as a public body under ORS 30.260, is entitled to the
protections of the Oregon Tort Claims Act. Plaintiff has failed
to allege compliance with the notice requirements of ORS 30.275.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, TriMet respectfully requests that this
Court grant its Motion to Dismiss with prejudice.

Respectfully submitted,
