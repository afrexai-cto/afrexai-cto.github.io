## Recommendations

1. **Schedule OSHA 30 renewal for Mike Dawson** (Riverside) before March 2 expiration. Online course available through BuildRight's SafetySkills account.
2. **Expand spotter requirements** for all forklift operations in congested staging areas (per NM-2026-002 corrective action) — apply company-wide, not just Marina Heights.
3. **Consider safety incentive program** for Q1 — 9 consecutive months LTI-free is an excellent milestone. Recommend recognition at next all-hands meeting.
4. **Pre-order additional PPE** for Downtown Parking Structure as crew size expected to increase 40% in February for foundation ramp-up.
