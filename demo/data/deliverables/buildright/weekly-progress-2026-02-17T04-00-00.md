## Recommendations

1. **Harbor View Tower:** Approve Saturday overtime ($18,400) to recover schedule. Without intervention, -2 days will compound during elevator shaft phase.
2. **Oakwood Elementary:** Confirm HVAC delivery date by Feb 24 — if delayed beyond Mar 28, it impacts the critical path.
3. **Marina Heights:** Schedule owner walkthrough for Units 1–4 by Feb 28 to get early finish selections confirmed.
4. **Riverside:** No concerns — project running smoothly. Consider as candidate for client site tour.
