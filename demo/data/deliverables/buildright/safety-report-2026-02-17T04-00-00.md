## Weather Impact Assessment

| Date | Site | Condition | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feb 13 | Harbor View Tower | Frost advisory (28°F overnight) | Masonry postponed; steel access delayed 45 min (ice). Near-miss NM-2026-003. |
| Feb 15 | All sites | Clear skies, 52°F | Full operations — no impact |

**Forecast (Feb 17–23):** Mostly clear, highs 48–55°F, lows 34–38°F. No precipitation expected. One potential frost night (Feb 19) — ice protocols will be activated at Harbor View Tower.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Formalize frost/ice protocol** company-wide — the ad-hoc response at Harbor View was effective but should be standardized in the Safety Manual (Section 4.7 — Weather Protocols). Draft update attached for Tom Bradley's review.
2. **Confirm Mike Dawson's OSHA 30 enrollment** — online course must be completed before Mar 2 expiration. If course timeline is tight, consider in-person 1-day refresher option.
3. **Order additional deicer kits** for Riverside Office Complex — curtain wall installation starting Feb 17 will have crews on exterior scaffolding; same frost risk applies.
4. **Schedule quarterly safety stand-down** for Q1 — recommend week of Mar 3. OSHA's suggested focus for 2026: heat illness prevention (early preparation for summer).
