## 5. Issues & Delays

| # | Issue | Impact | Action |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Delayed structural steel delivery** (Level 2 columns) — fabricator reports 8-day delay due to material shortage | **Critical path** — Level 2 deck pour pushed to ~Mar 5 | PM escalated with Cascade Steel Fab; exploring alternate supplier. Owner notified via PCO #BR105-004. |
| 2 | Exterior concrete pour postponed (weather) | 1 day slip on foundation wall segment F-3 | Rescheduled to Monday 2/23 if forecast holds |
| 3 | RFI #BR105-021 pending — conflict between electrical conduit routing and structural beam at grid line C-4 | Holding electrical rough-in in Zone C | Submitted to architect 2/19, awaiting response |

**Schedule Impact Summary:** Project currently 6 working days behind baseline. Steel delay is primary driver. Recovery plan under review.
