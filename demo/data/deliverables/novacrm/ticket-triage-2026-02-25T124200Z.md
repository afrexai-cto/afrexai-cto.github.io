# Support Triage Report — TK-4208

**Customer:** Starline Media

**Category:** How-To
**Priority:** Low
**SLA Window:** 24 hours
**Ticket Created:** 2026-02-15 15:20 UTC

## 1. Issue Classification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | Product Guidance — Feature Usage |
| Module | Email Campaign Builder |
| Complexity | Low |
| Tier | L1 — Self-Service / KB Redirect |

This is a **how-to request**, not a defect or outage. The customer needs guidance on using the email template builder feature within the NovaCRM campaign module.

## 2. Root Cause Hypothesis

Most likely causes (ranked by probability):

1. **New user onboarding gap** (65%) — Starline Media may be a recently onboarded account unfamiliar with the drag-and-drop template editor. The builder UI was updated in v4.2 (Jan 2026) and existing documentation may not match current layout.
2. **Specific feature discovery** (25%) — Customer may know the basics but needs help with a specific capability (conditional blocks, dynamic merge fields, mobile preview).
3. **UI bug masking as confusion** (10%) — Possible edge case where template builder fails to load certain block types in their browser/environment.

## 3. Recommended Resolution Steps

| Step | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Send KB article link: *"Getting Started with Email Templates"* (KB-1247) | Auto-responder |
| 2 | Include direct link to 3-min video walkthrough of template builder | Auto-responder |
| 3 | Ask clarifying question: "Which part of the template builder do you need help with? (a) Creating a new template, (b) Editing existing templates, (c) Using dynamic content blocks, (d) Something else" | L1 Agent |
| 4 | If customer replies with specific blocker, route to Product Specialist queue | L1 Agent |
| 5 | If no response within 48h, close with follow-up survey | Auto-close rule |

## 4. Estimated Resolution Time

| Scenario | Time |
|----------|------|
| KB article resolves it | < 1 hour (self-service) |
| Needs L1 guidance | 2–4 hours |
| Escalation to Product Specialist | 8–12 hours |

**Most likely:** Resolved within 2 hours via KB + clarifying response.

## 5. SLA Compliance Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SLA Target | 24 hours |
| Time Elapsed | ~237 hours (ticket aged) |
| Status | ⚠️ **SLA BREACHED** |

This ticket was created on Feb 15 and remains open as of Feb 25. The 24-hour SLA has been exceeded by approximately 9 days. **Immediate response required** despite low priority classification.

**Recommendation:** Flag this in the weekly SLA review. Consider auto-escalation rules for how-to tickets that remain open beyond 48 hours regardless of priority.

## 6. Escalation Assessment

| Decision | **No** — but immediate action needed |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Reason | This is a standard how-to inquiry resolvable at L1. However, the SLA breach requires a priority response and a manager notification per SLA breach protocol. |

**Action:** Assign to next available L1 agent with SLA breach flag. Include apology for delayed response in the reply template.

## 7. Knowledge Base Article Suggestion

| Article | ID |
|---------|-----|
| Getting Started with Email Templates | KB-1247 |
| Email Template Builder: Dynamic Content Blocks | KB-1312 |
| Video: Build Your First Campaign in 3 Minutes | KB-V089 |

If the customer's issue doesn't match existing KB content, flag for **KB gap analysis** — the template builder section may need an updated FAQ covering the v4.2 UI changes.
