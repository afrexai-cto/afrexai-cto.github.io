# Churn Risk Analysis — Oaktree Consulting

**Customer ID:** C020  
**Plan:** Growth ($1,900/mo MRR)  
**Health Score:** 38/100  
**CSM Assigned:** Jake Torres  
**Last Activity:** 2026-01-30  
**Onboarded:** 2025-10-10  

---

## 1. Risk Assessment Summary

**Overall Risk: 🔴 HIGH — Immediate intervention required**

Oaktree Consulting presents a critical churn risk. The health score of 38 places them in the bottom quartile of Growth-tier accounts. Combined with 22 days of inactivity and declining engagement, this account is trending toward non-renewal without intervention.

**Estimated churn probability: 72%** within the next 60 days if no action is taken.

## 2. Key Risk Indicators

| Indicator | Status | Weight |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Health score < 50 | ⚠️ 38/100 | Critical |
| Last login > 14 days | ⚠️ 22 days ago | High |
| MRR vs plan average | $1,900 vs $2,225 avg | Moderate |
| Time since onboarding | 4.3 months | Moderate |
| CSM contact frequency | Below baseline | High |

**Compounding factor:** Account is past the 90-day "adoption cliff" but hasn't reached the stickiness threshold typical of Growth accounts that retain past month 6.

---

## 3. Usage Trends Analysis

- **Login frequency** declined from ~4x/week (Nov 2025) to near-zero in February
- **Feature adoption** remains shallow — primary use limited to contact management; pipeline automation, reporting suite, and integrations unused
- **API calls** dropped 68% month-over-month (Jan → Feb)
- **User seats:** 3 of 8 licensed seats active — 62.5% seat waste suggests low organizational buy-in

The usage pattern is consistent with a "silent churn" trajectory: the customer hasn't complained, they've simply stopped using the product.

## 4. Engagement Score Breakdown

| Component | Score | Max | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----|-------|
| Product usage | 8 | 30 | Minimal logins, shallow feature use |
| Support tickets | 12 | 15 | Filed 2 tickets — both resolved, no open issues |
| CSM meetings | 5 | 20 | Last QBR missed; 1 of 3 scheduled calls attended |
| NPS/Feedback | 3 | 15 | No survey response submitted |
| Expansion signals | 10 | 20 | Initial interest in API integration, never activated |
| **Total** | **38** | **100** | |

The support score is actually healthy — Oaktree's issues were resolved. The problem isn't dissatisfaction with support, it's disengagement with the product itself.

## 5. Recommended Interventions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Executive reach-out** — Jake Torres to schedule a 1:1 with Oaktree's primary contact. Frame as a "check-in," not a save call. Goal: understand what changed.
2. **Usage audit email** — Send a personalized summary showing their unused features and the ROI they're leaving on the table. Include 2-3 quick wins they can activate in under 10 minutes.

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
3. **Re-onboarding session** — Offer a guided session focused specifically on pipeline automation (their highest-value unused feature given consulting workflows).
4. **Champion identification** — The original buyer may have moved on. Identify the current decision-maker and daily user(s).

### Medium-Term (30 Days)
5. **Success milestone plan** — Define 3 measurable outcomes tied to their business goals. Track weekly.
6. **Pricing review** — At $1,900/mo with 62.5% seat waste, consider right-sizing to a 5-seat Growth plan to reduce perceived cost while maintaining the relationship.

## 6. Retention Playbook Actions

- [ ] Trigger **"Win-Back: Silent Churn"** playbook sequence
- [ ] Send automated re-engagement email (Template: `growth-reactivation-v2`)
- [ ] Schedule CSM call within 48 hours
- [ ] Add to **weekly watch list** for pipeline review
- [ ] Flag for **VP Customer Success** review if no engagement within 7 days
- [ ] Prepare downgrade offer as fallback (Growth → Starter bridge at $900/mo for 3 months)

---

## 7. Escalation Recommendation

**Escalation: YES — to VP Customer Success**

Rationale:
- $1,900 MRR at risk ($22,800 ARR)
- Health score trajectory is downward with no inflection point
- Account represents a consulting vertical reference — losing them affects pipeline credibility for similar prospects
- 22-day inactivity gap is past the point where automated nudges are effective; this needs a human touch

**Recommended escalation timeline:** If no meaningful engagement within 5 business days of Jake's outreach, escalate to VP for executive sponsor involvement.
