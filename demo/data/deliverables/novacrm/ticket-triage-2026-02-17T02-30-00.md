## Auto-Triaged Tickets

### TK-4201 — SSO Integration Failing on Safari (Brightpath Education)
- **Priority:** High → **Routed to:** Engineering (Integration Team)
- **Category:** Integration bug — SAML assertion parsing fails on Safari 17.3
- **SLA:** 4 hours | **Time remaining:** 2h 15m
- **Triage Notes:** Reproduced in sandbox. Safari's stricter cookie handling causing session token drop. Known pattern — similar to TK-3892 (resolved Dec 2025). Linked to existing fix branch.

### TK-4210 — Account Access Locked (Oaktree Consulting)
- **Priority:** High → **Routed to:** Support Tier 1
- **Category:** Access — password reset loop
- **SLA:** 2 hours | **Time remaining:** 45m
- **Triage Notes:** Auto-detected MFA token desync. Sent password reset link with MFA bypass (24hr window). Flagged for CSM follow-up — account already at risk.

### TK-4206 — API Rate Limit Exceeded (Polaris Shipping)
- **Priority:** Medium → **Routed to:** Support Tier 2
- **Category:** Integration — rate limiting
- **Triage Notes:** Client hitting 1,000 req/min limit on Growth plan. Usage pattern suggests batch sync job running hourly. Recommended: implement exponential backoff + request plan upgrade to Enterprise (5,000 req/min).

### TK-4204 — Custom Webhook Endpoint Request (Apex Retail Group)
- **Priority:** Low → **Routed to:** Product (Feature Request Board)
- **Category:** Feature request
- **Triage Notes:** Enterprise customer requesting outbound webhook for order events. Added to product backlog. Existing workaround: Zapier integration. Sent workaround documentation to client.
