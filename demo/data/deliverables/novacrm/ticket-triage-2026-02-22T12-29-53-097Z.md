# Support Ticket Triage Report

## Ticket Information
**Ticket ID:** TK-4204  
**Customer:** Apex Retail Group  
**Subject:** Request for custom webhook endpoint  
**Priority:** Low  
**SLA Deadline:** 24 hours from submission  

---

## 1. Issue Classification

**Primary Category:** Feature Request - Integration Enhancement  
**Secondary Category:** Custom Development Request  
**Complexity Level:** Medium to High  
**Customer Impact:** Low (enhancement request, not blocking current operations)  

---

## 2. Root Cause Hypothesis

This is not a technical issue but rather a **business requirement** where the customer seeks to:
- Extend NovaCRM's current webhook capabilities
- Implement custom integration endpoints for their specific workflow
- Potentially integrate with third-party systems or internal applications
- Enhance their current data synchronization processes

**Underlying Need:** Customer likely requires specialized webhook functionality that exceeds standard webhook offerings in their current plan or NovaCRM's out-of-the-box capabilities.

---

## 3. Recommended Resolution Steps

### Immediate Actions (0-2 hours)
1. **Acknowledge receipt** and confirm understanding of the custom webhook requirement
2. **Gather detailed requirements** via standardized questionnaire:
   - Specific webhook events needed
   - Target endpoint specifications
   - Data payload requirements
   - Authentication preferences
   - Expected volume/frequency

### Assessment Phase (2-8 hours)
3. **Technical feasibility review** with Product/Engineering team
4. **Determine if request falls under:**
   - Existing enterprise features
   - Custom development scope
   - Third-party integration partnership

### Response Phase (8-24 hours)
5. **Provide comprehensive response** including:
   - Feasibility assessment
   - Implementation options (if available)
   - Pricing structure (if custom development required)
   - Timeline estimates
   - Alternative solutions using existing features

---

## 4. Estimated Resolution Time

**Initial Response:** 4-6 hours  
**Complete Assessment:** 16-20 hours  
**Final Recommendation:** 20-24 hours  

**Note:** If custom development is required, implementation timeline would be 2-8 weeks depending on complexity.

---

## 5. SLA Compliance Status

✅ **ON TRACK** - 24-hour SLA allows sufficient time for thorough assessment and response

**Recommended Response Timeframe:** Within 8 hours to demonstrate proactive support for feature requests

---

## 6. Escalation Needed

**Status:** YES - Conditional Escalation  

**Reason:** Feature requests requiring custom development must be escalated to:
- **Product Team** for feasibility assessment
- **Solutions Engineering** for technical scoping
- **Sales/Account Management** for pricing and contract considerations

**Escalation Trigger:** After initial requirement gathering is complete

- Standard webhook capabilities overview

- Pricing structure for custom development
- Alternative integration methods
- Timeline expectations
- Prerequisites and requirements gathering template

**Existing Articles to Reference:**
