## 5. Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunities

### Current Opportunities

**Note:** As a nonprofit organization, the Morrison Charitable Foundation is exempt from federal income taxes under IRC Section 501(c)(3). However, we monitor for potential Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) implications.

**UBIT Considerations:**
- Current REIT holdings generate minimal UBIT exposure (<$1,000 annually)
- Infrastructure investments structured to avoid UBIT
- No immediate tax-loss harvesting required

**Recommendations:**
- Maintain UBIT monitoring on alternative investments
- Consider tax-exempt municipal bond opportunities in high-tax states where foundation operates
- Structure any new alternative investments to minimize UBIT exposure
