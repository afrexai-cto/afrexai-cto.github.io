## 4. Rebalancing Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (30-60 days)

1. **International Equity Reduction**
   - **Action:** Reduce international equity from 22.8% to 20.0%
   - **Amount:** Sell approximately $798,000 in international holdings
   - **Rationale:** Exceeded target allocation due to recent outperformance

2. **Fixed Income Increase**
   - **Action:** Increase fixed income allocation from 32.5% to 35.0%
   - **Amount:** Purchase $712,500 in bonds
   - **Focus:** Intermediate-term Treasury and corporate bonds

3. **Commodities Reallocation**
   - **Action:** Increase commodities exposure from 2.0% to 3.0%
   - **Amount:** Add $285,000 to commodity funds
   - **Vehicle:** Diversified commodity ETF or direct commodity exposure

### Suggested Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Execute international equity reduction
- **Week 3-4:** Implement fixed income additions
- **Month 2:** Complete commodities allocation increase

## 5. Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunities

### Current Opportunities Identified

**Note:** As a pension fund, Greenfield is tax-exempt under IRC Section 501(a). However, we identify potential UBTI (Unrelated Business Taxable Income) considerations:

1. **REIT Holdings Review**
   - Monitor for potential UBTI from leveraged REIT investments
   - Current exposure: Minimal UBTI impact (<0.1% of portfolio)

2. **Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)**
   - No current MLP holdings - recommend maintaining this approach
   - Avoids UBTI complications while maintaining commodity exposure through other vehicles

3. **International Tax Withholding**
   - Foreign tax withholding: ~$23,000 annually
   - Consider increasing allocation to tax-efficient international funds

| Maximum Drawdown | -8.7% | <-12.0% | ✅ Acceptable |

### Risk Factor Analysis
