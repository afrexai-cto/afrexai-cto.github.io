## 2. Asset Allocation Analysis

### Current Allocation vs. Target

| Asset Class | Current % | Target % | Variance | Dollar Amount |
|-------------|-----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Fixed Income** | 62% | 60% | +2% | $5,518,000 |
| **Domestic Equity** | 25% | 25% | 0% | $2,225,000 |
| **International Equity** | 8% | 10% | -2% | $712,000 |
| **REITs** | 3% | 3% | 0% | $267,000 |
| **Cash/Money Market** | 2% | 2% | 0% | $178,000 |

### Analysis:
- **Fixed Income overweight** (+$178,000): Slight overallocation provides additional stability but may limit growth potential
- **International Equity underweight** (-$178,000): Missing diversification benefits and potential growth opportunities
- Overall allocation remains within acceptable tolerance bands (±3%)

## 5. Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunities

### Current Analysis:
As a **501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization**, the Morrison Charitable Foundation does not benefit from traditional tax-loss harvesting strategies. However, we recommend the following optimization approaches:

#### Alternative Strategies:
1. **UBIT Management**
   - Monitor any Unrelated Business Income Tax exposure from REIT holdings
   - Current UBIT liability: $0 (well within acceptable limits)

2. **Asset Location Optimization**
   - Maintain higher-yielding securities without tax drag concerns
   - Focus on total return rather than tax-adjusted returns

3. **Cash Flow Optimization**
   - Time distributions to align with charitable payout requirements (5% minimum)
   - Projected annual distribution capacity: ~$445,000

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Profile: **CONSERVATIVE** ✓

#### Key Risk Metrics:
- **Portfolio Beta:** 0.68 (vs market)
- **Maximum Drawdown (3-year):** -8.2%
- **Value at Risk (95% confidence):** -$267,000 (monthly)
- **Standard Deviation:** 6.2% (annualized)

#### Risk Factors Analysis:

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Well-diversified across asset classes and geographies
- ✅ High-quality fixed income holdings (average rating: AA-)
- ✅ Low correlation to volatile asset classes
- ✅ Adequate liquidity for operational needs

**Areas of Attention:**
- ⚠️ Interest rate sensitivity from bond duration (avg: 4.2 years)

#### Stress Test Results:
- **Rising Rate Scenario** (+200 bps): Estimated impact -4.1%
