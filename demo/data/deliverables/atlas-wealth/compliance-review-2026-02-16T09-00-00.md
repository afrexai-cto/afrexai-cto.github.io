## Critical Findings

### 🔴 AML/KYC Review Overdue — Kovalenko Account

**Regulation:** Bank Secrecy Act / AML Program
- **Client:** Viktor & Olena Kovalenko (Joint Account, $3.4M AUM)
- **Issue:** Enhanced due diligence review was due February 15. Account flagged for international wire transfers totaling $890,000 in Q4 2025 to/from Ukraine.
- **Risk:** Failure to complete timely EDD review violates firm AML procedures and could trigger SEC/FINRA examination findings.
- **Action Required:** Complete EDD review by February 19. Document source of funds for wire transfers. Update KYC documentation.
- **Assigned to:** David Nakamura (advisor) + Compliance

### 🔴 FINRA 4512 — Incomplete Customer Account Records

**Regulation:** FINRA Rule 4512
- **Client:** Greenfield Pension Fund ($28.5M AUM)
- **Issue:** Updated authorized signatory list not on file. Board of Trustees approved new treasurer (Sarah Kim) on January 8 — firm records still show former treasurer (Michael Dunn).

- **Action Required:** Obtain updated board resolution and signatory cards. Update account records by February 20.
- **Assigned to:** Margaret Liu (advisor) + Operations
