## Key Discussion Points

### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)
- **Age:** 73 (as of 2026) — RMD required for first time
- **Traditional IRA balance (Dec 31, 2025):** $420,000
- **2026 RMD amount:** $16,154 (using Uniform Lifetime Table, factor 26.0)
- **Deadline:** April 1, 2027 (first-year extension) or December 31, 2026 (to avoid double RMD in 2027)
- **Recommendation:** Take 2026 RMD by December 31 to avoid doubling up in 2027

### Social Security
- **Current status:** Not yet claiming
- **FRA benefit (age 67):** $2,840/month — already passed FRA
- **Delayed benefit (age 70):** $3,522/month (24% increase)
- **Break-even age:** 82 years
- **Life expectancy (actuarial):** 88 years
- **Recommendation:** Delay to age 70 if portfolio can support 3 more years of withdrawals. Current portfolio withdrawal rate of 3.2% is sustainable.

### Estate Planning
- **Last will update:** 2019 (7 years ago)
- **Beneficiaries on file:** Son (Thomas, 60%) and Daughter (Rachel, 40%)
- **Power of Attorney:** Current — Thomas Steinfeld
- **Healthcare Directive:** On file — dated 2019
- **Recommendation:** Review and update estate documents. Consider adding TOD designations on brokerage accounts.
