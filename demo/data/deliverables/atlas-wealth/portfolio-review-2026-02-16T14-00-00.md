## Key Holdings Review

### Top Performers
1. **NVDA** — +28.4% (AI infrastructure demand)
2. **Vanguard Total Intl Bond (BNDX)** — +6.2% (rate cut expectations)
3. **Prologis REIT (PLD)** — +12.1% (logistics demand)

### Underperformers
1. **iShares EM ETF (EEM)** — -2.3% (China property concerns)
2. **Pfizer (PFE)** — -8.1% (post-COVID revenue decline)

### Flagged for Review
- **Pfizer (PFE):** Position is 1.2% of portfolio. Recommend hold — dividend yield 5.8% supports income mandate. Reassess at next review if below $24.
- **Tesla (TSLA):** Position grown to 2.8% of portfolio from 1.5% allocation. Trim to target.

## Trust Distribution Requirements

- **Annual income distribution requirement:** $168,000 (4% of corpus)
- **Distributions made YTD:** $42,000 (Q1 scheduled)
- **Projected income generation:** $186,000 (dividends + interest)
- **Status:** ✅ On track — income exceeds distribution requirement

## Recommendations

1. **Rebalance international exposure** — move $130,000 from US large cap to MSCI EAFE index, $80,000 to EM index
2. **Trim Tesla** — sell $54,600 to bring back to 1.5% target
3. **Hold Pfizer** — income mandate supports current position despite price weakness
4. **Tax-loss harvest opportunity** — EEM position shows $9,200 unrealized loss, consider swap to VWO
5. **Schedule trustee review** — discuss rebalancing and 2026 distribution schedule
