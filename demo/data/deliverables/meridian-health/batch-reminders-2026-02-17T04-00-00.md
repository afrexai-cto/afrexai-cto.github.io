## Items Requiring Follow-Up

### 🔄 Rescheduling — Christine Hoffman

- **Original Appointment:** Feb 18, 10:30 AM — Dr. Hernandez (Internal Medicine)
- **Patient Response:** "Can't make Tuesday, can I come Thursday instead?"
- **Action Taken:** Checked Dr. Hernandez availability for Feb 20. Open slots: 9:00 AM, 11:30 AM, 2:00 PM.
- **Status:** Options sent to patient via SMS at 7:15 PM Feb 16. Awaiting selection.
- **Auto-Reschedule:** If no response by Feb 17 12:00 PM, front desk will call patient directly.

### 🔴 Flagged — Robert Chen

- **Original Appointment:** Feb 19, 2:00 PM — Dr. Reyes (Dermatology) — Urgent visit
- **Issue:** Patient replied "I already cancelled this last week"
- **System Check:** No cancellation record found in EHR. Last status update: "Scheduled" (entered Feb 14 by Patient Coordinator Agent).
- **Action Required:** Front desk to verify with patient and Dr. Reyes's office. If patient did call to cancel, investigate why it wasn't recorded — possible intake process gap.
- **Escalated To:** Office Manager Denise Wu

### ⏳ No Response — 3 Patients

| Patient | Appointment | Second Reminder | Phone Call Scheduled |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fatima Al-Rashid | Feb 18, 9:00 AM | ✅ Sent 8:00 AM Feb 17 | Feb 17, 11:00 AM |
| Amina Mohamed | Feb 18, 2:00 PM | ✅ Sent 8:00 AM Feb 17 | Feb 17, 11:00 AM |
| Grace Okonkwo | Feb 19, 10:00 AM | ✅ Sent 8:00 AM Feb 17 | Feb 17, 2:00 PM |

Per practice policy, patients with no response after second reminder receive a phone call from front desk. If unreachable by 4:00 PM the day before, appointment is held but flagged for potential no-show.

## No-Show Risk Assessment

Based on historical patterns and confirmation status:

| Risk Level | Patients | Est. No-Show Probability |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Low (confirmed) | 14 | <5% |
| 🟡 Medium (no response) | 3 | 25–35% |
| 🔴 High (flagged/reschedule) | 2 | 50%+ |

**Estimated No-Shows:** 1–2 appointments
**Recommendation:** If Hoffman reschedule is confirmed, consider offering her 10:30 AM slot to waitlist patient Sarah Mitchell (requested any available Hernandez opening).
