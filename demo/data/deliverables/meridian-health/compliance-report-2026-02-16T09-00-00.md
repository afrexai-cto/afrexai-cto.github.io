## Risk Assessment

- **Regulatory Exposure:** LabCorp BAA lapse creates active HIPAA liability. No data breaches reported during lapse period, but continued PHI exchange without valid BAA must be remediated within 5 business days.
- **Operational Impact:** Quest Diagnostics handles ~340 test orders/month. Suspension would require rerouting to LabCorp (pending their renewal) or backup vendor.
- **Financial Risk:** Maximum OCR penalty exposure for willful neglect (corrected): up to $50,000 per violation category.

## Action Items

| Priority | Action | Owner | Deadline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Critical | Execute LabCorp BAA renewal | Legal / Compliance | Feb 21, 2026 |
| 🟡 High | Finalize Quest Diagnostics renewal | Legal | Feb 24, 2026 |
| 🔵 Medium | Send SecureShred renewal package | Compliance | Mar 15, 2026 |
| 📋 Routine | Set 90-day alerts for all BAAs expiring in Q2 | Compliance Officer Agent | Feb 17, 2026 |
