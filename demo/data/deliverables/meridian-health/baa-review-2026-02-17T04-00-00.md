## Critical Updates Since Last Review

### 🔴 EXPIRED — LabCorp Diagnostics (ESCALATED)

- **BAA Status:** Expired since January 31, 2026 — now **17 days overdue**
- **Agreement ID:** BAA-2024-LC-0087
- **Update:** LabCorp legal returned redlined draft on Feb 15 with 4 substantive changes to indemnification and breach notification clauses. Our legal team counter-proposed on Feb 16. Awaiting LabCorp response.
- **PHI Exposure:** 312 lab orders processed since expiration without valid BAA
- **Risk Level:** 🔴 **Critical** — Continued operation without BAA constitutes willful HIPAA violation
- **Recommended Action:** If not executed by Feb 21, suspend all PHI transmissions to LabCorp and reroute to Quest Diagnostics (pending their renewal) or backup vendor MedLab Direct
- **Escalated To:** Chief Compliance Officer Margaret Wu, General Counsel David Park

### 🔴 NEW FINDING — PharmaCorp Rx (Non-Compliant Language)

- **BAA Status:** Active (expires Sep 30, 2026) but **non-compliant with 2025 HIPAA Final Rule**
- **Agreement ID:** BAA-2025-PC-0203
- **Issue:** Section 7.2 (Breach Notification) requires notification within 60 days. The 2025 HIPAA Final Rule (effective Jan 1, 2026) reduced the maximum notification window to **30 days** for breaches affecting 500+ individuals.
- **Impact:** PharmaCorp processes prescription data for ~4,200 patients. A breach affecting this population under the current BAA language would leave Meridian non-compliant with federal notification requirements.
- **Risk Level:** 🔴 **High** — Amendment required
- **Recommended Action:** Issue BAA amendment to update Section 7.2 to 30-day notification window. Template amendment drafted and attached for legal review.

### 🟡 ON TRACK — Quest Diagnostics

- **BAA Status:** Expiring February 28, 2026 — **11 days remaining**
- **Agreement ID:** BAA-2024-QD-0112
- **Update:** Legal review completed Feb 16. Clean draft sent to Quest for countersignature. Expected execution by Feb 21.
- **Risk Level:** 🟡 Medium — On track but monitoring daily

## Amended BAA Template — PharmaCorp Section 7.2

For Breaches affecting 500 or more individuals, Business Associate shall provide Covered Entity with sufficient information to enable Covered Entity to comply with the 30-day individual notification requirement under §164.404(b).
