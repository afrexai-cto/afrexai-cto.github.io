## Anomalies Flagged

### 🔴 Anomaly 1: After-Hours Bulk Access — Admin Department

**User**: T. Novak (Admin)
**Date**: February 14, 2026, 11:42 PM
**Action**: Accessed 14 patient records in 23 minutes, exported 7

**Concern**: Unusual volume and export rate outside business hours. Pattern inconsistent with normal administrative workflow. No scheduled batch processing was authorized for this date.

**Recommended Action**: Immediate supervisor review. Request written justification from T. Novak. If no valid business reason, escalate to Privacy Officer and consider access restriction pending investigation.

**Priority**: HIGH

### 🟡 Anomaly 2: Cross-Department Record Access

**User**: M. Rodriguez (Radiology Tech)
**Date**: February 12, 2026, 3:15 PM
**Action**: Viewed 4 Cardiology patient records not associated with any imaging orders

**Concern**: Access to records outside scope of role. No corresponding radiology orders or referrals found for these patients.

**Recommended Action**: Verify with Cardiology whether cross-referral was in progress. If no clinical justification, provide additional HIPAA training and add access flag to user profile.

**Priority**: MEDIUM

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate T. Novak's after-hours access immediately** — request written justification within 48 hours, consider temporary access restriction.

2. **Implement role-based access alerts** — configure automatic notifications when users access records outside their department without a linked referral or order.

3. **Renew LabCorp BAA before March 15** — current agreement expires in 26 days. Contact vendor relations to initiate renewal.

4. **Schedule HIPAA refresher training** for Dr. Patel and Nurse Williams — both are 3 weeks overdue for annual certification.
