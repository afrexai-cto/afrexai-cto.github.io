**To:** Estate Representative — Williams Family
**From:** Michael Tanaka, Esq. — Pacific Legal Group
**Date:** February 25, 2026
**Re:** Probate Administration — Estate of Harold Williams (Case No. 26-PR-04182)

Dear Williams Family,

I'm writing to provide you with a status update on the probate administration of Harold's estate.

## Current Status

The final accounting has been approved by the court as of February 19, 2026. We are now in the distribution phase, which is the final substantive step before we can close the estate.

## Recent Actions Taken

- **Feb 12:** Filed the final accounting and petition for distribution with Multnomah County Probate Court
- **Feb 19:** Court approved the final accounting without objection
- **Feb 21:** Received signed court order authorizing distribution per the approved accounting
- **Feb 24:** Initiated wire transfers for liquid asset distributions to beneficiaries listed in Schedule A

## Upcoming Deadlines

| Item | Date | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Complete cash distributions to beneficiaries | **Feb 25, 2026** | In progress |
| Transfer deed for 4812 Hawthorne Blvd property | Feb 28, 2026 | Pending |
| File receipts of distribution with court | Mar 7, 2026 | Pending |
| Petition for discharge of personal representative | Mar 14, 2026 | Pending |

## Asset Distribution Summary

Per the court-approved final accounting:

- **Liquid assets (bank accounts, securities):** $487,312.44 — distributing today across 4 beneficiaries
- **Real property (4812 Hawthorne Blvd):** Transfer deed being prepared for Margaret Williams per the will
- **Personal property:** Already distributed per family agreement dated Jan 8, 2026
- **Estate expenses & fees:** $31,208.16 — settled from estate funds prior to distribution

## Next Steps

1. Confirm receipt of wire transfers with each beneficiary (today/tomorrow)
2. Record the transfer deed with Multnomah County — David in our real estate group is handling the recording
3. Collect signed receipts of distribution from all beneficiaries
4. File final receipts and petition to discharge the personal representative
5. Close the estate

## Action Needed

We need signed receipts of distribution from each beneficiary once they confirm funds received. I'll be sending those forms individually by email tomorrow. Please return them within 5 business days so we can stay on track for the March filing.
