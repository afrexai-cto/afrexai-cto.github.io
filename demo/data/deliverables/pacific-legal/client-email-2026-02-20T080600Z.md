**Re:** Estate of Harold Williams — Probate Administration Update

Dear Williams Family,

I'm writing to provide you with an update on the progress of the Estate of Harold Williams probate administration.

## Current Status

The final accounting has been approved by the court, and we are now in the asset distribution phase. All creditor claims have been resolved and the statutory notice period has closed without objection.

## Recent Actions Completed

- Final accounting filed and accepted by the Multnomah County Probate Court on February 14, 2026
- All outstanding creditor claims settled or disallowed per court order
- Tax clearance letter received from Oregon Department of Revenue
- Federal estate tax return (Form 706) filed and accepted — no additional liability assessed
- Real property appraisals finalized for distribution valuations

## Upcoming Deadlines

| Item | Deadline |
|------|----------|
| **Asset distribution per final accounting** | **February 25, 2026** |
| File receipts of distribution with court | March 11, 2026 |
| Petition for discharge of personal representative | March 25, 2026 |

## Next Steps

1. **Distribution execution (by Feb 25):** Transfer titled assets, issue checks for cash bequests, and coordinate brokerage account transfers per the distribution schedule attached to the final accounting.
2. **Beneficiary acknowledgments:** Each beneficiary will receive a receipt of distribution to sign and return within 14 days.
3. **Estate closure:** Once all receipts are filed, we will petition the court to formally discharge the personal representative and close the estate.

## Action Needed From You

Please confirm your current mailing addresses and preferred method for receiving distributions (direct deposit or check) by **Monday, February 23**. This ensures we meet the court-ordered distribution deadline without delay.

If you have any questions or need to discuss any aspect of the distribution, please don't hesitate to reach out to Michael Tanaka directly at (503) 555-0147 or mtanaka@pacificlegalgroup.com.
