## 3. Non-Standard or Concerning Clauses

### 3.1 — No Rent Escalation Clause
The lease specifies a flat $31.50/sq ft for the entire 5-year term. While favorable to Tenant, this is unusual in Portland's commercial market. **Risk:** Landlord may attempt to introduce escalations via amendment or dispute the flat-rate interpretation. Recommend explicitly confirming no CPI or annual adjustment applies.

### 3.2 — No Assignment or Subletting Provision
The agreement is silent on Tenant's right to assign or sublet. Under Oregon law (ORS 91.240), restrictions on assignment must be expressly stated. **Risk:** Ambiguity could lead to disputes if Tenant needs to sublease unused space. Recommend adding a clause permitting subletting with Landlord's reasonable consent.

### 3.3 — No Early Termination or Default Cure Period
No termination-for-convenience clause. No cure period for defaults by either party. **Risk:** Any breach could trigger immediate action without opportunity to remedy. Recommend adding a 30-day written cure period for non-monetary defaults and 10 days for monetary defaults.

### 3.4 — Silent on CAM / Operating Expenses
No mention of Common Area Maintenance charges, property taxes, or pass-through expenses. **Risk:** If this is intended as a gross lease, it should state so explicitly. If modified gross or NNN, the omission is a material gap.

### 3.5 — No Renewal Option
No option to renew beyond March 2031. For a 5-year commitment, Tenant should negotiate at least one 3-5 year renewal option at pre-agreed terms.

## 4. Risk Assessment

| Risk Area | Severity | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| CAM/OpEx ambiguity | **High** | Could expose Tenant to unanticipated pass-throughs |
| No cure period | **High** | Either party vulnerable to aggressive enforcement |
| No subletting rights | **Medium** | Limits flexibility if business needs change |
| No renewal option | **Medium** | Tenant loses leverage at lease end |
| Flat rent (no escalation) | **Low** | Favorable to Tenant but verify Landlord's intent |
| Insurance limits | **Low** | $1M/$2M is standard for this property class |

---

## 5. Recommended Modifications

1. **Add Section: Operating Expenses** — Clarify whether lease is gross, modified gross, or NNN. Define CAM obligations, base year, and cap on annual increases (recommend 5% cap).

2. **Add Section: Default and Cure** — 10-day cure for monetary defaults, 30-day cure for non-monetary defaults, with written notice required.

3. **Add Section: Assignment and Subletting** — Tenant may assign or sublet with Landlord's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

4. **Add Section: Renewal Option** — One 5-year renewal option at then-prevailing market rate, exercisable with 180 days' written notice.

5. **Amend Section 3 (Base Rent)** — Explicitly confirm flat rate with no escalation, OR negotiate a known escalation schedule (e.g., 2.5% annual increase) for certainty.

6. **Add Section: Holdover** — Define holdover rent (typically 150% of last month's rent) to avoid ambiguity at term end.

7. **Amend Section 4 (Security Deposit)** — Specify return timeline (Oregon standard: 31 days post-termination) and conditions for deductions.

---

## 6. Overall Recommendation

**⚠️ APPROVE WITH CHANGES**

The lease covers fundamentals competently but has material gaps — particularly around operating expenses and default remedies — that create unnecessary risk for both parties. The recommended modifications are standard commercial lease provisions and should not be contentious in negotiation. Advise Tenant's counsel to present a redline incorporating the above before execution.
