**Client**: Nakamura Holdings
**Matter**: Corporate Restructuring
**Attorney**: Sarah Chen

**To**: Kenji Nakamura (k.nakamura@nakamuraholdings.com)
**From**: Pacific Legal Group
**Subject**: Nakamura Holdings — Restructuring Update & Upcoming Board Deadline

---

Dear Kenji,

I wanted to provide you with an update on the restructuring matter and flag an important upcoming deadline.

## Current Status

The corporate restructuring is progressing well. Here's where we stand:

**Completed this week:**
- Filed the amended Articles of Organization with the Oregon Secretary of State (confirmation #OR-2026-041882)
- Finalized the revised Operating Agreement reflecting the new subsidiary structure
- Distributed the updated capitalization table to all equity holders for review

**In progress:**
- Tax counsel (Morrison & Foerster) is completing the Section 368 analysis for the asset transfers — we expect their memo by February 21
- The intellectual property assignment agreements are in final review for the three patents transferring to the new subsidiary

## Upcoming Deadline — Action Required

**Board Resolution — Due February 28, 2026**

The Board must formally approve the restructuring plan before we can execute the asset transfers. To meet the March 15 closing target, we need the resolution signed by February 28.

**What we need from you:**
1. Confirm the board meeting date (we recommend February 26 or 27)
2. Review the draft resolution (attached to your secure portal) and provide any comments by February 24
3. Ensure all four board members are available to sign

Sarah has prepared the draft resolution and supporting materials — they're available in your client portal now.

## Next Steps

| Action | Owner | Due Date |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Board meeting scheduled | Kenji | Feb 21 |
| Draft resolution comments | Kenji | Feb 24 |
| Tax memo delivered | Morrison & Foerster | Feb 21 |
| Board resolution signed | Board | Feb 28 |
| Asset transfer execution | Pacific Legal | Mar 1–15 |

## Billing Note

Current fees through February 15: $14,200 (within the $18,000 Phase 2 estimate). We remain on track to complete within budget.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Sarah is available Tuesday and Thursday this week for a call if you'd like to discuss the resolution in more detail.

Best regards,
