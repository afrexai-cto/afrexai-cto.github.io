The missing operating expense provisions alone could dramatically increase the effective rent beyond the stated base rent.

### **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Immediate Action Required:**
   - Request comprehensive operating expense disclosure
   - Obtain market comparisons for similar properties
   - Negotiate essential protective clauses

2. **Pre-Execution Requirements:**
   - Property inspection and environmental assessment
   - Verification of landlord's authority and financial capacity
   - Title and lien search on the property

3. **Timeline Consideration:**
   - Allow 2-3 weeks for meaningful negotiations
   - Consider lease commencement flexibility given negotiation needs
