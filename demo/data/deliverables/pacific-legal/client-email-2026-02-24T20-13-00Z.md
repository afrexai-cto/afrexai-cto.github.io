# Client Status Update — Estate of Harold Williams

**To:** Williams Family Representatives
**From:** Michael Tanaka, Pacific Legal Group
**Date:** February 24, 2026
**Re:** Probate Administration — Asset Distribution Update

---

Dear Williams Family,

I wanted to reach out with an update on the probate administration for Harold's estate as we approach the final distribution phase.

## Current Status

The court approved our final accounting on February 14, and the 10-day objection period has now passed without contest. We are cleared to proceed with asset distribution per the terms of the will and the court-approved accounting.

## Recent Actions Taken

- Final accounting filed and approved by Multnomah County Probate Court
- All creditor claims have been resolved and paid from the estate
- Tax clearance received from the Oregon Department of Revenue
- Beneficiary verification completed for all named parties

## Upcoming Deadline

**February 25, 2026** — We intend to begin executing distributions on this date. The estate checking account will issue transfers to each beneficiary per the approved schedule.

## Next Steps

1. Wire transfers will be initiated for liquid assets on February 25
2. Real property deed transfers (the Hawthorne residence) will be recorded with the county within 5 business days
3. Vehicle title transfers will be submitted to Oregon DMV
4. A final distribution receipt will be sent to each beneficiary for signature
5. Once all receipts are returned, we will file the petition to close the estate

## Action Needed

Please confirm that the banking details we have on file for each beneficiary are still current. If any account information has changed since our last correspondence, contact our office by end of day tomorrow so we can update our records before transfers are initiated.

You can reach me directly at (503) 555-0147 or mtanaka@pacificlegalgroup.com.

Thank you for your patience throughout this process. We're pleased to be bringing Harold's wishes to completion.

Warm regards,

**Michael Tanaka**
Attorney at Law
Pacific Legal Group
