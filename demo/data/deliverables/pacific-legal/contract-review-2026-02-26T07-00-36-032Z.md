## 3. NON-STANDARD OR CONCERNING CLAUSES

### 🚨 **CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Missing Operating Expense Provisions**
   - No CAM (Common Area Maintenance) charges specified
   - No utility responsibility allocation
   - No property tax pass-through provisions

2. **Absence of Rent Escalation**
   - Fixed rent for 5-year term creates landlord disadvantage in inflationary periods
   - No CPI adjustments or percentage increases

3. **Incomplete Termination Provisions**
   - No early termination rights specified
   - Default and cure period terms absent
   - No holdover penalty provisions

4. **Missing Standard Commercial Clauses**
   - No assignment/subletting restrictions
   - No alterations approval process
   - No parking allocation
   - No signage rights

### ⚠️ **MODERATE CONCERNS:**

1. **Security Deposit Terms**
   - Interest-bearing requirement unusual for commercial leases
   - No specification of interest rate or distribution method

2. **Maintenance Responsibilities**
   - Vague "good working condition" standard
   - No emergency repair procedures outlined

---

## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT

### **HIGH RISK:**
- **Hidden Costs:** Absence of operating expense terms could result in unexpected additional charges
- **Rent Certainty:** No escalation clauses may indicate below-market initial rent with potential for aggressive renewal terms

### **MEDIUM RISK:**
- **Default Remedies:** Lack of specific default/cure provisions creates enforcement uncertainties
- **Use Limitations:** "General office purposes" may be too restrictive for business expansion

### **LOW RISK:**
- **Insurance Requirements:** Standard commercial coverage levels
- **Jurisdiction:** Oregon law provides adequate commercial landlord-tenant protections

---

## 5. RECOMMENDED MODIFICATIONS

### **ESSENTIAL ADDITIONS:**

1. **Operating Expenses Clause**
   ```
   Add comprehensive CAM, utilities, insurance, and tax pass-through provisions
   with annual reconciliation requirements and expense caps (recommend 5-7% annual increases)
   ```

2. **Default and Remedies Section**
   ```
   Include 10-day monetary cure period, 30-day non-monetary cure period,
   and specific landlord remedies including termination and re-entry rights
   ```

3. **Assignment and Subletting Provisions**
   ```
   Standard commercial language allowing assignment/subletting with landlord consent
   (not to be unreasonably withheld)
   ```

### **RECOMMENDED CLARIFICATIONS:**

4. **Rent Escalation Mechanism**
   - Add 3% annual increases or CPI adjustments (whichever is greater)
   - Include market rate review in year 3

5. **Parking and Common Area Rights**
   - Specify number of assigned parking spaces
   - Define common area usage rights and restrictions

6. **Security Deposit Refinements**
   - Clarify interest rate (suggest prevailing savings rate)
   - Add deposit return timeline (30 days post-termination)

### **ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS:**

7. **Force Majeure Clause** (Post-COVID consideration)
8. **Compliance with Laws** provision
9. **Quiet Enjoyment** guarantee
10. **Notice Procedures** with specific addresses

---

## 6. OVERALL RECOMMENDATION

### **RECOMMENDATION: APPROVE WITH SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS**

**Rationale:**
- Basic lease structure is commercially reasonable
- Rental rate appears market-competitive for Portland office space
- Parties and property adequately identified
- Standard maintenance allocation present

**CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL:**

1. **MANDATORY:** Add comprehensive operating expense and default provisions
2. **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED:** Include rent escalation and assignment clauses  
3. **ADVISABLE:** Clarify security deposit terms and add standard commercial protections

**NEGOTIATION STRATEGY:**
Focus on operating expense transparency and default remedy provisions as deal-critical items. The absence of rent escalations may indicate room for negotiation on other tenant-favorable terms.

**ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE REVISIONS:** 3-5 business days with cooperative parties
