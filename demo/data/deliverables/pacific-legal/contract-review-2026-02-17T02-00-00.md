# Contract Review — Commercial Lease Agreement

**Pacific Legal Group** | Document Analyst AI Agent
**Matter**: Chen Industries LLC — Office Lease

## Executive Summary

Reviewed a proposed 5-year commercial lease agreement for 3,200 sq ft of Class A office space at 450 Morrison Street, Portland, OR 97204. Base rent of $28.00/sq ft ($89,600/year) is within market range for the Pearl District. However, **three non-standard clauses present material risk** to the tenant and should be negotiated before execution.

**Recommendation: APPROVE WITH CHANGES** ⚠️

## Flagged Clauses

### 🔴 Clause 1: Broad Indemnification (Section 14.2)

**Current Language**: *"Tenant shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from or related to Tenant's use of the Premises or any act or omission of Tenant."*

**Risk**: This is an unlimited, one-directional indemnification that could expose Chen Industries to liability for claims caused by Landlord's own negligence. The phrase "related to Tenant's use" is overly broad.

**Recommended Change**: Add mutual indemnification. Insert carve-out: *"except to the extent caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord."* Cap indemnification at the policy limits of Tenant's required insurance.

**Risk Level**: HIGH

### 🔴 Clause 2: One-Sided Termination (Section 22.1)

**Current Language**: *"Landlord may terminate this Lease upon 90 days' written notice if Landlord determines, in its sole discretion, that the building requires substantial renovation or redevelopment."*

**Risk**: Gives Landlord unilateral right to terminate for vaguely defined "renovation" with only 90 days' notice. No equivalent right for Tenant. No relocation assistance or early termination compensation mentioned. This effectively makes the 5-year term illusory.

**Recommended Change**: Either remove entirely, or add: (a) minimum 12 months' notice, (b) relocation assistance equal to 6 months' rent, (c) reimbursement of unamortized TI costs, and (d) right of first refusal to return post-renovation at current rate.

**Risk Level**: HIGH

### 🟡 Clause 3: Ambiguous Maintenance Obligations (Section 9.3)

**Current Language**: *"Tenant shall be responsible for maintenance and repair of the Premises, including but not limited to HVAC systems serving the Premises."*

**Risk**: "Including but not limited to" creates ambiguity about scope. HVAC maintenance for a full-floor tenant typically falls to the landlord as part of CAM charges. This clause could shift $8,000–15,000/year in unexpected costs to Chen Industries.

**Recommended Change**: Define explicitly which systems are Tenant responsibility vs. Landlord/CAM. Standard for this building class: Landlord maintains base building HVAC, Tenant maintains supplemental units only. Strike "including but not limited to" and replace with a specific maintenance matrix.

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

## Recommended Modifications

1. **Section 14.2**: Add mutual indemnification with negligence carve-out and insurance cap
2. **Section 22.1**: Remove or substantially revise with 12-month notice + compensation package
3. **Section 9.3**: Replace with specific maintenance responsibility matrix
4. **Section 5.1** (minor): Clarify that 3% annual escalation applies to base rent only, not CAM charges
5. **Section 28** (minor): Add right to install signage on suite entry without prior approval

## Conclusion

The lease is commercially reasonable in its core financial terms but contains three clauses that create disproportionate risk for the tenant. The termination clause (Section 22.1) is the most concerning — it effectively allows the landlord to end a 5-year commitment with 90 days' notice. I recommend engaging the landlord's counsel on all three flagged items before execution. If Sections 14.2 and 22.1 cannot be satisfactorily amended, consider alternative properties.
