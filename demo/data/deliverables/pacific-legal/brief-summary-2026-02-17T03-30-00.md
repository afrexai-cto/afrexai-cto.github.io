# Legal Brief Summary — Opposition to Summary Judgment

**Case:** Greenfield Industries, Inc. v. TechCo Solutions LLC
**Case No.:** 2025-CV-08934
**Court:** U.S. District Court, District of Oregon
**Filed:** February 14, 2026
**Motion:** Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Trade Secret Misappropriation Count)
**Response Deadline:** March 7, 2026

---

## Case Overview

Greenfield Industries alleges TechCo Solutions misappropriated proprietary manufacturing process data when three senior engineers (James Holden, Priya Kapoor, and Marcus Webb) departed Greenfield and joined TechCo between March and May 2025. Greenfield claims the engineers brought confidential CAD files, process optimization algorithms, and client pricing models, which TechCo then used to underbid Greenfield on two contracts worth $4.2M combined.

The complaint asserts claims under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. §1836), Oregon Trade Secrets Act (ORS 646.461), breach of employment agreements (non-compete and NDA provisions), tortious interference with business relationships, and unjust enrichment.

## Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Arguments

1. **Undisputed Misappropriation:** Greenfield presents forensic evidence that Holden copied 2,847 files from Greenfield's secure server to a personal USB drive on March 12, 2025 — his last day of employment. Digital forensics firm CyberTrace confirmed file metadata matches Greenfield's proprietary repository.

2. **Trade Secret Status Established:** Greenfield's manufacturing processes are protected by NDAs, access controls (role-based authentication), and physical security (badge-restricted R&D lab). They argue no reasonable jury could find these are not trade secrets under the 6-factor *Restatement* test.

3. **Use in Commerce:** Within 60 days of Holden's start at TechCo, TechCo filed two patent applications covering processes "substantially similar" to Greenfield's methods. Expert report from Dr. Susan Choi (MIT) finds 89% overlap in process parameters.

4. **Irreparable Harm:** Greenfield lost the Meridian Manufacturing and Coastal Fabrication contracts (combined $4.2M) after TechCo submitted bids 15-22% below Greenfield's pricing — margins only achievable with knowledge of Greenfield's cost structure.

## Key Evidence Cited

| Exhibit | Description | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Ex. A | CyberTrace forensic report | USB copy of 2,847 files on Holden's last day |
| Ex. B | File comparison analysis | 94% filename match between USB contents and Greenfield R&D server |
| Ex. C | TechCo patent applications | Filed April 2025; Dr. Choi identifies 89% process overlap |
| Ex. D | Holden employment agreement | Non-compete (18 months), NDA (indefinite for trade secrets) |
| Ex. E | Greenfield security protocols | Role-based access, encrypted storage, visitor logs |
| Ex. F | Bid comparison — Meridian Mfg contract | TechCo bid $1.8M vs. Greenfield $2.3M |
| Ex. G | Kapoor text messages | Texts to Webb: "bring the specs, they'll never check" |

## Potential Defense Arguments

1. **Independent Development:** TechCo may argue its processes were developed independently by its existing R&D team. However, the 60-day timeline between Holden's hire and patent filing creates strong inference of misappropriation.

2. **Not Trade Secrets — Industry Knowledge:** TechCo could argue the manufacturing processes reflect general industry knowledge rather than protectable secrets. Weak argument given Greenfield's documented security measures and the specificity of the copied files.

3. **Genuine Disputes of Material Fact:** The strongest defense is that summary judgment is premature — credibility determinations (did Holden actually use the files at TechCo?) and the independent-development defense both present jury questions.

4. **Kapoor & Webb Lack Direct Evidence:** The USB evidence only ties to Holden. Greenfield's case against Kapoor and Webb relies on circumstantial evidence and text messages that may be subject to context disputes.

## Strength Assessment

### For Granting Summary Judgment
- Forensic evidence of file copying is essentially undisputed
- Trade secret status is strong given documented protective measures
- Expert overlap analysis (89%) is compelling
- Text message evidence (Ex. G) is damaging

### Against Granting Summary Judgment
- "Use" element requires showing TechCo actually relied on the files — Holden copying files doesn't prove TechCo used them
- Independent development is a fact question for the jury
- 89% overlap alone doesn't prove causation — could reflect industry convergence
- Partial summary judgment on liability still leaves damages for trial, limiting efficiency gains

## Recommended Response Strategy

1. **Oppose on "use" element** — Argue that copying alone does not establish misappropriation; plaintiff must show actual use in TechCo's operations. Cite *Waymo LLC v. Uber Techs.* (N.D. Cal. 2017) for the distinction between acquisition and use.

2. **Challenge the expert report** — File *Daubert* motion to exclude Dr. Choi's "overlap" methodology. 89% parameter similarity may reflect industry standards rather than misappropriation. Request hearing before summary judgment ruling.

3. **Assert independent development defense** — Present TechCo's R&D timeline, pre-existing research, and prior patent applications to create genuine factual dispute.

4. **Distinguish Kapoor and Webb** — Move to sever or separately address claims against the other two engineers, where evidence is materially weaker.

5. **Request Rule 56(d) continuance** if needed — Discovery on TechCo's internal development records may not be complete.

**Estimated Likelihood of Full Summary Judgment Granted:** Low-Moderate (25–35%)
**Estimated Likelihood of Partial Summary Judgment (copying = acquisition):** Moderate (45–55%)
**Recommended Strategy:** Oppose and create fact questions for trial
