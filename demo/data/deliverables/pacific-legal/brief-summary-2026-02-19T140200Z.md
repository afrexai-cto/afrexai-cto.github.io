# Legal Brief Summary & Analysis

## Johnson v. TriMet — Case No. 3:25-cv-01847-SI

**Document Type:** Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Rule 12(b)(6))
**Filed by:** Rachel Abrams, OSB No. 142587 — Pacific Legal Group LLP
**Court:** U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, Portland Division

---

## 1. Case Overview

Plaintiff Marcus Johnson alleges personal injuries sustained on September 14, 2025, while boarding a TriMet MAX Light Rail vehicle at Pioneer Courthouse Square station. Johnson claims the train operator negligently closed the doors during his boarding. TriMet moves to dismiss the entire complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.

## 2. Key Arguments

| # | Argument | Legal Basis |
|---|----------|-------------|
| I | **Insufficient factual pleading** — Plaintiff's complaint contains only conclusory negligence allegations without identifying the specific duty breached or how TriMet's conduct fell below the standard of care. | *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) — facial plausibility standard |
| II | **Oregon Tort Claims Act bar** — TriMet is a public body under ORS 30.260 and Plaintiff has not alleged compliance with the notice requirements of ORS 30.275. | ORS 30.260, ORS 30.275 |

## 3. Legal Standards Cited

- **Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)** — Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted
- **Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)** — Plausibility standard for surviving a motion to dismiss
- **Oregon Tort Claims Act (ORS 30.260–30.275)** — Sovereign immunity protections and mandatory notice provisions for claims against Oregon public bodies

## 4. Strengths & Weaknesses

### Strengths of the Motion
- **Notice requirement argument is strong.** Oregon courts strictly enforce ORS 30.275 notice provisions. If Plaintiff truly failed to provide the required 180-day notice, this is likely dispositive on its own.
- **Iqbal/Twombly pleading standard** is well-established at the federal level. Conclusory allegations without factual specificity are routinely dismissed.
- **Clean procedural posture** — early-stage dismissal avoids discovery costs.

### Weaknesses / Risks
- **Plaintiff can likely amend.** Even if granted, the Court will almost certainly allow leave to amend under Rule 15(a). The complaint's deficiencies appear curable — Plaintiff could add factual detail about the door closure and allege notice compliance.
- **Motion does not address the underlying merits.** If Plaintiff amends with adequate factual detail and proper notice, the negligence claim (door closing on a boarding passenger) is facially plausible and may survive.
- **Public sympathy factor.** Transit injury cases involving passengers tend to generate sympathetic fact patterns at trial.
- **Brief is concise to a fault.** No case law specific to Oregon tort claim notice dismissals is cited. Bolstering with *Flug v. University of Oregon*, 335 Or 540 (2003) or similar would strengthen the OTCA argument.

## 5. Recommended Response Strategy

1. **Prepare for the amendment.** Assume Plaintiff will be granted leave to amend. Begin investigating the factual record now — review station camera footage, operator logs, and door mechanism maintenance records for September 14, 2025.
2. **Verify OTCA notice compliance independently.** Confirm with TriMet's claims department whether any tort claim notice was received from Johnson. If none exists, preserve that documentation — it becomes the strongest defense.
3. **Consider a conditional strategy.** If the motion is granted with leave to amend, use the interim period to initiate early settlement discussions if exposure warrants it. Transit negligence cases in Oregon can produce unpredictable jury verdicts.
4. **Supplement the brief.** Before oral argument, file a reply brief citing Oregon-specific OTCA dismissal precedent and addressing any opposition arguments regarding the sufficiency of the pleadings.
