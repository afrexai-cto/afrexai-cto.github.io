## 5. RECOMMENDED MODIFICATIONS

### **CRITICAL ADDITIONS**

1. **Insert Rent Escalation Provision**
   ```
   Base rent shall increase annually by 3% or the Consumer Price Index 
   increase for the Portland metropolitan area, whichever is greater, 
   but not to exceed 5% in any given year.
   ```

2. **Add Operating Expense Clause**
   ```
   In addition to base rent, Tenant shall pay its proportionate share 
   (4.2% based on rentable square feet) of building operating expenses, 
   including but not limited to property taxes, insurance, utilities, 
   and common area maintenance.
   ```

3. **Define Default and Remedies**
   ```
   Include specific default events, 10-day monetary cure period, 
   30-day non-monetary cure period, and landlord remedies including 
   lease termination and damages.
   ```

### **RECOMMENDED ADDITIONS**

4. **Assignment/Subletting Rights**
5. **Force Majeure Clause**
6. **ADA and Environmental Compliance**
7. **Renewal Option** (beneficial for tenant)
8. **Dispute Resolution Mechanism**
9. **Early Termination Rights** (with penalty structure)

---

## 6. OVERALL RECOMMENDATION

### **🔶 APPROVE WITH SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATIONS**

**Rationale:** While the basic lease structure is sound, critical financial and operational provisions are missing. The contract requires significant amendments before execution.

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

1. **Negotiate rent escalation clause** - Critical for landlord protection
2. **Clarify operating expense allocation** - Prevents future disputes  
3. **Add comprehensive default provisions** - Protects both parties
4. **Include assignment/subletting terms** - Provides tenant flexibility
5. **Insert force majeure clause** - Addresses unforeseen circumstances

### **APPROVAL CONDITIONS**

- [ ] Rent escalation provision added
- [ ] Operating expenses clearly defined
- [ ] Default/remedy clauses comprehensive
- [ ] Assignment rights addressed
- [ ] Compliance requirements included

### **ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION**
If landlord refuses escalation clause, consider **shorter initial term (2-3 years)** with **renewal options** to provide rent adjustment opportunities.
