## Case Overview

Plaintiff Rosa Martinez filed a personal injury claim against State Farm Insurance Company arising from a denied underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage claim. Martinez was rear-ended on I-5 on August 12, 2025 by an underinsured driver. She sustained cervical spine injuries, a herniated disc (C5-C6), and soft tissue damage. Her medical expenses total $87,432 to date.

State Farm denied the UIM claim on October 3, 2025, citing insufficient documentation of causation and arguing pre-existing degenerative disc condition. Martinez's complaint alleges breach of contract, bad faith denial of insurance benefits, and violation of California Insurance Code §790.03 (unfair claims settlement practices).

## Defendant's Key Arguments

1. **Failure to State a Bad Faith Claim:** State Farm argues Martinez has not alleged facts sufficient to show the denial was unreasonable. They contend the claim was properly investigated and denied based on legitimate medical review by Dr. Harold Stevens (independent medical examiner).

2. **Pre-Existing Condition Bar:** Defense asserts Martinez's medical records from 2023 show degenerative disc disease at C5-C6 predating the accident, and plaintiff fails to plead specific facts distinguishing accident-related injury from pre-existing condition.

3. **Statutory Claim Deficiency:** State Farm argues the §790.03 claim fails because a single coverage denial does not constitute a "pattern" of unfair practices as required under Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman's Fund (1988).

4. **Speculative Damages:** Defense contends future medical cost projections ($145,000) are speculative and cannot support a breach of contract claim at the pleading stage.

## Plaintiff's Position (From Complaint)

1. **Clear Coverage Entitlement:** Policy unambiguously covers UIM claims up to $250,000. The accident and injuries are well-documented via police report, ER records, and treating physician (Dr. Angela Reyes, orthopedic specialist).

2. **Bad Faith Pattern:** State Farm delayed 53 days before assigning an adjuster, requested duplicate documentation three times, and relied on a single 15-minute IME to deny the claim — consistent with systematic undervaluation.

3. **Causation Established:** Dr. Reyes's declaration states the herniation is acute and consistent with rear-impact trauma, distinguishable from prior degenerative findings on MRI comparison.

## Applicable Legal Standards

- **Rule 12(b)(6):** Dismiss only if complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Court must accept all factual allegations as true and draw reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor. (*Blank v. Kirwan*, 1985)
- **Bad Faith Standard:** Insurer acts in bad faith when it unreasonably withholds benefits due under the policy. (*Egan v. Mutual of Omaha*, 1979)
- **§790.03 Private Right of Action:** Post-*Moradi-Shalal*, no direct private action for single violations, but bad faith tort claim remains viable independently.

## Strengths & Weaknesses Analysis

### Strengths of Defendant's Motion
- The §790.03 statutory claim is likely deficient under *Moradi-Shalal* — this count may be dismissed
- Pre-existing condition argument creates factual complexity that could narrow the complaint
- 12(b)(6) motions rarely succeed on bad faith claims, but partial dismissal is plausible

### Weaknesses of Defendant's Motion
- Bad faith claims are highly fact-intensive — courts strongly disfavor dismissal at pleading stage
- Martinez's complaint includes specific factual allegations (53-day delay, 15-minute IME, triple document requests) that exceed bare conclusory assertions
- Breach of contract claim is straightforward: valid policy + covered event + denial = sufficient pleading
- Pre-existing condition is an affirmative defense, not properly raised on 12(b)(6)

## Recommended Response Strategy

1. **Concede the §790.03 count** or voluntarily amend to remove it — preserves credibility and eliminates defendant's strongest argument. The bad faith tort claim covers the same conduct independently.

2. **Oppose dismissal on breach of contract and bad faith counts** — emphasize the liberal pleading standard and cite *Wilson v. 21st Century Ins.* (2007) (bad faith claims survive 12(b)(6) when specific denial conduct is alleged).

3. **File Dr. Reyes's supplemental declaration** distinguishing acute herniation from degenerative findings — preempt the pre-existing condition argument even though it's premature at this stage.

4. **Request leave to amend** as alternative relief if court finds any deficiency — standard practice, rarely denied at this stage.

**Estimated Likelihood of Full Dismissal:** Low (15–20%)
**Estimated Likelihood of Partial Dismissal (§790.03 only):** Moderate-High (65–70%)
