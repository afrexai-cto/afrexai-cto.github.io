   - Detailed CAM provisions and tenant's proportionate share
   - Utility allocation and payment responsibility
   - Late fee provisions (typically 5% after 10-day grace period)
   ```

2. **Expand Insurance Requirements**
   ```
   - Property insurance covering tenant improvements
   - Workers' compensation if employees present
   - Mutual waiver of subrogation clause
   - 30-day notice requirement for policy changes
   ```

   - Assignment and subletting provisions with landlord consent requirements
   ```

### **Priority 2 - Important Clarifications**

1. **Maintenance and Repairs**
   ```
   - Define "normal wear and tear"
   - Specify tenant improvement responsibilities
   - Address HVAC maintenance allocation within leased premises
   ```

2. **Operational Provisions**
   ```
   - Parking allocation and fees
   - Signage rights and restrictions
   - Hours of access and building security procedures
   ```

### **Priority 3 - Protective Provisions**

---

## 6. OVERALL RECOMMENDATION

**🟡 APPROVE WITH SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS**

### **Rationale:**
The lease structure and basic terms are commercially reasonable, but the document is substantially incomplete for a 5-year commercial lease. The missing provisions create significant risk exposure for both parties and potential for disputes.

### **Conditions for Approval:**
1. **Mandatory inclusion** of all Priority 1 modifications
2. **Strong recommendation** to include Priority 2 clarifications  
3. **Legal review** of any additional terms not included in this excerpt
4. **Financial analysis** of market comparables for rent escalation terms

### **Timeline Recommendation:**
Given the April 1, 2026 commencement date, these modifications should be negotiated and incorporated within 30 days to allow adequate time for final review and execution.
