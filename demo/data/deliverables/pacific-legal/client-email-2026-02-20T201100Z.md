**Subject: Update on Your Employment Dispute — Settlement Offer Review**

Dear Carlos,

Thank you for your patience as we work through the details of your employment dispute. I wanted to provide you with a comprehensive update on where things stand.

## Current Case Status

We received the employer's settlement offer on February 14th and have been conducting a thorough review. Attorney Sarah Langford has completed her initial assessment and identified several points that require discussion before we respond.

## Recent Actions Taken

- **Settlement Offer Analysis** — We reviewed the proposed terms, including the compensation figure, non-disparagement clause, and reference letter provisions
- **Comparable Case Research** — Our team benchmarked the offer against recent employment dispute settlements in the same jurisdiction and industry sector
- **Financial Impact Assessment** — We calculated the net value of the offer after accounting for legal fees, tax implications, and projected lost wages through trial

## Key Observations

The current offer addresses your core compensation claim but includes a non-compete extension that could limit your job search for an additional 6 months beyond the original agreement. We believe this point is negotiable and recommend pushing back on the scope and duration.

The severance figure falls approximately 15-20% below what we'd expect given the strength of your documentation and the employer's exposure.

## Upcoming Deadlines

| Item | Date |
|------|------|
| Response to settlement offer | **February 24, 2026** (extended from Feb 17) |
| Mediation session (if needed) | March 10, 2026 |
| Discovery cutoff | April 1, 2026 |

Sarah successfully negotiated a one-week extension on the response deadline to ensure we have time to discuss strategy with you.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Schedule a call with Sarah** — We'd like 30 minutes to walk you through the settlement analysis and our counter-proposal strategy
2. **Review the attached comparison** — We've prepared a side-by-side of the offer terms vs. our recommended counter-terms
3. **Confirm your priorities** — Understanding whether speed of resolution or maximizing the financial outcome matters more will shape our response

## Action Needed

Please reach out to schedule a call at your earliest convenience. Sarah has availability Monday through Wednesday next week, mornings or late afternoon. You can book directly at (415) 555-0142 or reply to this email with your preferred times.

We're confident in our position and believe there's meaningful room to improve the terms. Looking forward to discussing the path forward with you.

Warm regards,

**Client Follow-up Coordinator**
