# Legal Brief Summary & Analysis

**Case:** Johnson v. Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (TriMet)
**Case No.:** 3:25-cv-01847-SI
**Court:** U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, Portland Division
**Document:** Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)
**Filed by:** Rachel Abrams, OSB No. 142587 — Pacific Legal Group LLP

---

## 1. Case Overview

Plaintiff Marcus Johnson alleges personal injury sustained on September 14, 2025 while boarding a TriMet MAX Light Rail vehicle at Pioneer Courthouse Square station. Plaintiff claims the train operator negligently closed the doors during his boarding, causing injuries. The nature and extent of injuries are not specified in this filing.

TriMet moves to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety with prejudice under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing Plaintiff fails to state a plausible claim for relief.

## 2. Key Arguments

### Argument I — Failure to State a Negligence Claim
Defense contends Plaintiff's Complaint relies on conclusory allegations of negligence without identifying:
- The specific duty of care breached
- How TriMet's conduct fell below the applicable standard of care
- Factual specificity beyond bare legal conclusions

Cites *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) for the plausibility pleading standard.

### Argument II — Oregon Tort Claims Act (OTCA) Bar
Defense asserts sovereign immunity protections under ORS 30.260, arguing Plaintiff failed to allege compliance with the mandatory pre-suit notice requirements of ORS 30.275 (180-day notice to public body).

## 3. Legal Standards Cited

| Citation | Proposition |
|---|---|
| Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) | Failure to state a claim — dismissal standard |
| *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662 (2009) | Facial plausibility requirement for surviving MTD |
| ORS 30.260 | Definition of "public body" under OTCA |
| ORS 30.275 | Pre-suit notice requirements for tort claims against public bodies |

## 4. Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths of the Motion
- **OTCA notice defense is procedural and potentially dispositive.** If Plaintiff cannot demonstrate timely notice under ORS 30.275, the claim fails regardless of merits. This is the strongest argument.
- **Iqbal pleading standard is well-established.** Courts regularly dismiss conclusory negligence allegations lacking factual support.
- **Seeks dismissal with prejudice** — aggressive but appropriate if both arguments succeed.

### Weaknesses / Vulnerabilities
- **Plaintiff can likely amend.** Even if the Court finds the current complaint conclusory, courts routinely grant leave to amend under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) rather than dismiss with prejudice on the first motion. Dismissal without prejudice is the more likely outcome on the pleading insufficiency argument alone.
- **Common carrier doctrine.** TriMet as a public transit operator may be held to a heightened duty of care toward passengers. The brief does not address or distinguish this, which Plaintiff's counsel will likely raise in opposition.
- **Factual plausibility may exist.** Plaintiff identified a specific date, location, and mechanism of injury (doors closing during boarding). A court could find this meets the *Iqbal*/*Twombly* threshold, especially in a personal injury context where courts apply a more lenient standard.
- **OTCA notice compliance may exist but was simply not pled.** Plaintiff's counsel may have filed notice but omitted it from the Complaint — opposition will likely attach the notice as an exhibit.

## 5. Recommended Response Strategy

### If Opposing This Motion (Plaintiff's Perspective)
1. **File opposition brief** attaching proof of OTCA notice compliance under ORS 30.275 (if notice was timely sent). This neutralizes the strongest argument immediately.
2. **Argue factual sufficiency** — the Complaint identifies date, location, transit line, and mechanism of injury. Cite *Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.*, 534 U.S. 506 (2002) for notice pleading principles.
3. **Invoke common carrier heightened duty** — TriMet owes passengers the highest degree of care. Cite *Dickens v. TriMet*, Oregon state precedent on transit operator duty.
4. **Request leave to amend** in the alternative — courts strongly favor resolving cases on the merits.

### If Supporting This Motion (Defense Next Steps)
1. Prepare reply brief anticipating OTCA notice exhibit from Plaintiff.
2. Research whether Plaintiff actually filed timely ORS 30.275 notice — if yes, pivot strategy to summary judgment on merits.
3. Consider adding a common carrier duty analysis in reply to preempt opposition arguments.

### Overall Assessment
**Probability of full dismissal with prejudice: Low (15-20%).** The OTCA notice argument is the strongest path, but only if Plaintiff genuinely failed to provide notice. The pleading insufficiency argument alone is unlikely to result in dismissal with prejudice — more likely dismissal without prejudice with leave to amend. Recommend preparing for the case to proceed past the pleading stage.
