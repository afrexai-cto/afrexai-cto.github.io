# Contract Review: Commercial Lease Agreement

**Greenfield Acquisitions LLC → Kimura Commercial Properties Inc.**
**Reviewed by:** Document Analyst Agent — Pacific Legal Group
**Date:** February 18, 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This is a straightforward 5-year commercial lease for 4,200 sq ft of office space at 1420 NW Everett Street, Suite 300, Portland, OR. Annual rent is $132,300 ($31.50/sq ft), with a $22,050 security deposit (two months' rent). The agreement is relatively concise at 8 sections, which itself raises flags — several standard protective clauses are **missing entirely**.

**Overall Assessment:** The lease favors the Landlord. Tenant is exposed on multiple fronts due to absent provisions.

## 3. Non-Standard or Concerning Clauses Flagged

### 🔴 Critical Gaps (Missing Provisions)

1. **No Rent Escalation Clause** — Over a 5-year term, the absence of a defined escalation mechanism is unusual. This could mean the Landlord intends to negotiate increases ad hoc, or it could be an oversight that locks rent at $31.50/sq ft. Clarification needed — if Landlord later claims an implied annual increase, Tenant has no cap protection.

2. **No Renewal or Extension Option** — Tenant has zero guaranteed rights after March 2031. For a 5-year commitment this is a significant risk; Tenant should negotiate at minimum a 2-year renewal option at a pre-agreed rate.

3. **No Early Termination Clause** — Neither party has a defined exit mechanism short of full breach. If Tenant's business needs change in Year 3, they're locked in for the remaining term with no out.

4. **No Assignment/Subletting Provision** — The lease is silent on whether Tenant can assign or sublet. Under Oregon law (ORS 91.220), a general restriction on assignment requires Landlord consent, but silence creates ambiguity.

5. **No Default and Remedies Section** — No cure periods, no notice requirements, no defined remedies for either party's breach. This is a serious structural deficiency.

6. **No CAM / Operating Expense Provisions** — No mention of common area maintenance charges, property taxes, or operating expense pass-throughs. Is this a gross lease? If so, it should say so explicitly. If not, Tenant could face surprise charges.

### 🟡 Moderate Concerns

7. **Security Deposit Return Timeline** — While the interest-bearing separate account requirement is favorable to Tenant, there's no stated timeline for return after lease expiration. Oregon statute (ORS 90.300) applies to residential; commercial deposits are governed by the lease terms, which are absent here.

8. **Insurance — No Property/Contents Coverage Required** — Only CGL is specified. No requirement for Tenant's property insurance, business interruption, or workers' comp. While this may benefit Tenant in the short term, it exposes both parties.

9. **Maintenance Boundary Ambiguity** — "Building systems" maintained by Landlord includes HVAC, but what about dedicated HVAC units serving only the Premises? This is a common dispute point.

## 4. Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Level | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Financial Exposure | **Medium** | Rent is market-rate for Portland CBD (~$28-35/sq ft). No hidden escalators, but no caps either. |
| Legal Exposure | **High** | Missing default/remedies, assignment, and termination provisions create significant ambiguity. |
| Operational Risk | **Medium** | No subletting rights limit flexibility if Tenant needs to downsize. |
| Regulatory Risk | **Low** | Oregon commercial lease law is well-established. Permitted use is standard. |
| Exit Risk | **High** | No early termination + no subletting = 5-year hard lock on $661,500 total obligation. |

**Total 5-Year Financial Commitment:** $661,500 base rent + $22,050 deposit = **$683,550**

## 5. Recommended Modifications

**Must-Have (Before Execution):**

1. **Add Default & Remedies clause** — 30-day written notice and cure period for non-monetary defaults; 10-day notice for monetary defaults. Specify Landlord's right to re-enter and Tenant's right to cure.

2. **Add Assignment/Subletting clause** — Permit subletting with Landlord's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

3. **Add Renewal Option** — One 3-year renewal option at 103% of then-current rent, exercisable with 180 days' written notice.

4. **Clarify Lease Structure** — Explicitly state whether this is a gross lease or modified gross. If CAM/OpEx pass-throughs apply, cap annual increases at CPI or 3% (whichever is lower).

5. **Add Early Termination clause** — After month 36, Tenant may terminate with 6 months' notice and payment of 3 months' rent as an early termination fee.

**Should-Have:**

6. **Security deposit return** — Within 30 days of lease expiration, with itemized deduction statement.

7. **Tenant improvement allowance** — Negotiate $10-15/sq ft TI allowance ($42,000-$63,000) given the 5-year commitment.

8. **Force majeure clause** — Standard provision for events beyond parties' control.

9. **HVAC maintenance boundary** — Clarify that dedicated suite HVAC units are Landlord's responsibility for major repairs (compressor, condenser) and Tenant's for filters and routine service.

## 6. Overall Recommendation

### ⚠️ APPROVE WITH CHANGES

The core economics are reasonable for the Portland market. However, the lease is dangerously incomplete — it reads more like a letter of intent than an executable lease. The missing provisions (default/remedies, assignment, termination, expense structure) expose Tenant to material legal and financial risk.

**Do not execute in current form.** Redline with the modifications above and return to Landlord's counsel. Expected negotiation timeline: 2-3 weeks.
