## 1. Case Overview

Marcus Johnson (Plaintiff) alleges personal injury sustained on September 14, 2025, while boarding a TriMet MAX Light Rail vehicle at Pioneer Courthouse Square station. Johnson claims the train operator negligently closed the vehicle doors during his boarding attempt. TriMet moves to dismiss the entire complaint for failure to state a claim.

## 2. Key Arguments

| # | Argument | Legal Basis |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Plaintiff's complaint contains only conclusory allegations of negligence without identifying the specific duty breached or the applicable standard of care | Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) |
| 2 | Plaintiff fails to allege compliance with the notice requirements of the Oregon Tort Claims Act | ORS 30.260; ORS 30.275 |

## 3. Legal Standards Cited

- **Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)** — Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The complaint must contain "sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face."
- **Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)** — Plausibility standard for surviving a motion to dismiss.
- **Oregon Tort Claims Act (ORS 30.260, ORS 30.275)** — Statutory notice requirements and sovereign immunity protections for public bodies, including TriMet.

## 4. Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths of the Motion
- **Iqbal plausibility standard is well-established.** If the complaint truly contains only bare "negligent" assertions without factual specificity, the 12(b)(6) argument is strong.
- **OTCA notice defense is procedural and potentially dispositive.** Failure to comply with the 180-day notice requirement under ORS 30.275 would bar the claim regardless of its merits.
- **Motion seeks dismissal with prejudice**, which would prevent re-filing.

### Weaknesses / Risks
- **Courts construe complaints liberally at the 12(b)(6) stage.** Even minimal factual allegations (date, location, mechanism of injury) may be deemed sufficient to survive dismissal.
- **The Iqbal argument may be overstated.** Plaintiff did allege a specific incident: a named station, a specific date, and a specific act (door closure during boarding). A court may find this sufficiently factual.
- **OTCA notice defense depends on the record.** If Plaintiff did file timely notice but simply failed to plead it, the court may grant leave to amend rather than dismiss with prejudice.
- **No case-specific Oregon negligence authority cited.** The brief relies heavily on federal standards without addressing Oregon common carrier or transit authority precedent.

## 5. Recommended Response Strategy

1. **Oppose the motion with an amended complaint.** Proactively add factual detail — the specific duty of care owed by a common carrier operator, the precise sequence of events, witness identification, and medical injury details.
2. **Address OTCA compliance directly.** Attach the tort claims notice as an exhibit or plead specific compliance with ORS 30.275(2) timelines. If notice was not timely filed, evaluate whether any statutory exceptions apply (e.g., substantial compliance, discovery rule).
3. **Request leave to amend in the alternative.** Even if the court finds the current complaint deficient, argue that dismissal should be without prejudice and with leave to amend.
4. **Research Oregon transit negligence precedent** — particularly common carrier duty cases and TriMet-specific litigation history in the District of Oregon.
5. **Evaluate whether the "with prejudice" request is supportable.** First motions to dismiss are rarely granted with prejudice absent futility — push back on this framing.
