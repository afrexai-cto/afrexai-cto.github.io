## 1. Executive Summary

This is a five-year commercial lease for 4,200 sq ft of office space at 1420 NW Everett Street, Suite 300, Portland, OR 97209. Annual rent is $132,300 ($31.50/psf), with a two-month security deposit held in an interest-bearing account. The agreement is structurally straightforward but contains several notable gaps that expose the Tenant to material risk.

## 3. Non-Standard or Concerning Clauses

### 3.1 — No Rent Escalation Clause
The lease specifies a flat $31.50/psf for the entire 5-year term. While favorable to the Tenant, this is unusual. Landlord may seek to amend before execution. **Tenant should lock this in explicitly** with language confirming no annual increases.

### 3.2 — No Early Termination or Assignment Provisions
There is no sublease, assignment, or early termination clause. This binds the Tenant to the full 60-month obligation with no exit mechanism if business needs change.

### 3.3 — Maintenance Boundary Ambiguity
Section 6 assigns structural and building systems to Landlord and "interior" to Tenant, but does not address:
- Shared restrooms or common-area corridors
- Window replacements or treatments
- Floor coverings beyond normal wear
- Technology infrastructure (cabling, data rooms)

### 3.4 — No CAM / Operating Expense Pass-Throughs
The lease is silent on Common Area Maintenance charges, property tax pass-throughs, and operating expense escalations. This needs explicit clarification — either confirm this is a gross lease or define NNN terms.

### 3.5 — No Holdover Provision
No language addresses what happens if the Tenant remains after March 31, 2031. Standard practice is 150-200% of rent on a month-to-month holdover basis.

### 3.6 — Insurance Gaps
Tenant's CGL requirements are specified, but the lease does not require:
- Property insurance on Tenant's improvements/contents
- Business interruption coverage
- Workers' compensation confirmation
- Landlord's obligation to carry property/casualty on the building

## 4. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| No exit mechanism | 🔴 High | 60-month hard commitment, no assignment/sublease |
| CAM/NNN ambiguity | 🔴 High | Could result in unexpected cost pass-throughs |
| No holdover terms | 🟡 Medium | Exposes Tenant to unfavorable post-term rent |
| Maintenance gaps | 🟡 Medium | Dispute risk over grey-area repairs |
| Insurance gaps | 🟡 Medium | Inadequate coverage allocation |
| No rent escalation | 🟢 Low (favorable) | Benefits Tenant; confirm it's intentional |
| No force majeure | 🟡 Medium | No pandemic/disaster relief provision |

---

## 5. Recommended Modifications

1. **Add Assignment & Sublease clause** — Allow assignment with Landlord's reasonable consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). Include an early termination option after month 36 with 6 months' notice and a termination fee of 3 months' rent.

2. **Clarify CAM/Operating Expenses** — Insert explicit language confirming this is a full-service gross lease, or define the NNN structure with caps on annual escalation (recommend 3-5% cap).

3. **Add Holdover Provision** — Month-to-month at 125% of the then-current rent with 90 days' notice to vacate.

4. **Expand Insurance Requirements** — Require Landlord to maintain building property/casualty insurance. Add Tenant property insurance and business interruption minimums.

5. **Add Force Majeure clause** — Standard provision excusing performance delays due to events beyond reasonable control.

6. **Define Maintenance Grey Areas** — Specify responsibility for common areas, HVAC filters/servicing (vs. full system replacement), and technology infrastructure.

7. **Add Dispute Resolution** — Include mediation-first, then arbitration in Portland, OR, before litigation.

---

## 6. Overall Recommendation

### ⚠️ APPROVE WITH CHANGES

The lease provides favorable base economics for the Tenant (flat rent, interest-bearing deposit), but has significant structural gaps — particularly the absence of exit mechanisms and CAM clarity. These are standard commercial lease provisions, and their omission suggests either an early draft or inexperienced drafting.

**Priority actions before execution:**
1. Negotiate assignment/early termination rights (critical)
2. Confirm gross vs. NNN structure in writing (critical)
3. Add holdover, force majeure, and dispute resolution (important)

**Estimated time to negotiate modifications:** 2-3 weeks with cooperative counterparty.
