## 3. NON-STANDARD OR CONCERNING CLAUSES

### 🚨 **CRITICAL GAPS - HIGH PRIORITY**

1. **No Rent Escalation Clause**
   - 5-year term with fixed rent may not account for market changes or inflation
   - Industry standard includes 2-3% annual increases

2. **Missing Operating Expense Provisions**
   - No mention of CAM charges, property taxes, or insurance pass-throughs
   - Unusual for commercial leases of this type

3. **Incomplete Insurance Requirements**
   - No property insurance requirements specified
   - Missing workers' compensation requirements
   - No certificate of insurance delivery timeline

### ⚠️ **MODERATE CONCERNS**

4. **Vague Space Description**
   - "Approximately 4,200 square feet" lacks precision
   - No measurement standard specified (usable vs. rentable)

5. **Limited Permitted Use**
   - Restrictive "solely for general office purposes" language
   - May limit business flexibility

6. **Missing Standard Commercial Provisions**
   - No default/cure period provisions
   - No assignment/subletting terms
   - No holdover provisions
   - No force majeure clause

---

## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT

### **HIGH RISK ITEMS**
- **Financial Exposure**: Unclear operating expense obligations could result in unexpected costs
- **Rent Certainty**: Fixed rent over 5 years may become below-market, but provides cost certainty for Tenant
- **Insurance Gap**: Insufficient insurance coverage requirements create liability exposure

### **MODERATE RISK ITEMS**
- **Space Measurement**: Potential disputes over actual square footage
- **Use Restrictions**: Limited flexibility for business evolution
- **Maintenance Ambiguity**: Interior/exterior maintenance boundaries unclear

### **LOW RISK ITEMS**
- **Governing Law**: Standard Oregon law application
- **Security Deposit**: Reasonable amount with interest-bearing requirement
- **Basic Terms**: Standard lease structure present

---

## 6. OVERALL RECOMMENDATION

### **RECOMMENDATION: APPROVE WITH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES**

**Rationale:**
- Basic lease structure is sound and terms are commercially reasonable
- Missing provisions are standard market terms that can be negotiated
- Financial terms appear favorable to Tenant (fixed rent, reasonable deposit)
- Location and space details are appropriate for intended use

**Priority Action Items:**
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Add operating expense and rent escalation provisions
2. **BEFORE EXECUTION**: Complete insurance requirements and default terms
3. **RECOMMENDED**: Include assignment, force majeure, and measurement clarifications

**Negotiation Strategy:**
- Leverage the apparent completeness of the current draft to negotiate favorable terms for missing provisions
- Focus on cost predictability given the 5-year term
- Ensure operating expense caps and reasonable escalation terms

**Timeline Recommendation:**
Given the February 1, 2026 lease date and April 1, 2026 commencement, there is adequate time to negotiate these modifications without impacting the intended timeline.
