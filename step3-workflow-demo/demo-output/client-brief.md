## 4. The Dispute — Preliminary Analysis

### Background
Meridian entered into a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with GlobalFreight in June 2023 for exclusive freight forwarding services across Meridian's client portfolio. The MSA has an estimated annual value of £2.8M and runs to June 2028.

### Key Issues
1. **Exclusivity clause** — GlobalFreight alleges Meridian breached exclusivity by engaging alternative carriers for two client accounts. Meridian's position (per intake) is that these accounts fell outside the MSA scope.
2. **Service failures** — Meridian reports persistent service failures by GlobalFreight including late deliveries, damaged goods, and failure to meet KPIs defined in Schedule 3 of the MSA.
3. **Threatened termination** — GlobalFreight has threatened to terminate the MSA and claim £1.2M in damages for alleged breach.
4. **Meridian's counterclaim** — Potential counterclaim for service failures, estimated at £800K–£1.5M based on client compensation paid and lost business.

### Preliminary Risk Assessment
| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Strength of exclusivity defence | **Medium-High** — Scope carve-outs likely exist; need to review MSA |
| Service failure counterclaim | **Strong** — If KPI data supports, very credible |
| Litigation risk | **Medium** — GlobalFreight's financial pressure may favour settlement |
| Estimated exposure | £1.2M (claim) vs £800K–£1.5M (counterclaim) |
| Recommended strategy | Robust defence + strong counterclaim → negotiate from strength |

## 5. Comparable Matters

- **LogiTrans v Carrier Express [2024] EWHC 1892 (Comm)** — Similar exclusivity dispute in logistics. Court held that exclusivity clauses must be construed strictly and ambiguities resolved against the party seeking to enforce. Helpful precedent.
- **Nexus Freight v Atlantic Shipping [2023] EWCA Civ 445** — Court of Appeal confirmed that persistent KPI failures can constitute repudiatory breach. Relevant to counterclaim.

## 6. Recommendations for Welcome Call
1. Obtain and review the MSA immediately — the exclusivity clause wording is critical
2. Request KPI performance data for the past 12 months
3. Identify the two accounts GlobalFreight claims breach the exclusivity
4. Confirm whether any without-prejudice discussions have taken place
5. Discuss early engagement strategy — consider pre-action protocol letter
