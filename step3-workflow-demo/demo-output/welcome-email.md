Dear Sarah,

Thank you for instructing Hartwell Associates in relation to the contract dispute with GlobalFreight PLC. We appreciate Marcus Webb's kind referral and are pleased to assist.

I have asked **David Osei**, Senior Associate in our Commercial Disputes team, to work alongside me on this matter. David has extensive experience with logistics sector disputes and exclusivity arrangements, and will be your day-to-day point of contact.

**Immediate next steps:**

1. **Welcome call** — We have scheduled an introductory call for **Monday 24 February at 10:00 AM GMT** (calendar invite to follow). David and I will both attend. Please have the master services agreement with GlobalFreight to hand if possible.

2. **Document collection** — We will need the following at your earliest convenience:
   - The master services agreement with GlobalFreight PLC (including all amendments and schedules)
   - Any correspondence relating to the dispute (emails, letters, without prejudice communications)
   - Board minutes or internal memos discussing the GlobalFreight relationship
   - Financial records showing the value of the arrangement

3. **Engagement letter** — Our formal engagement letter and fee schedule will follow separately. We will discuss fee arrangements during our call.

4. **Compliance** — As required by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, we will need to complete identity verification for Meridian SCS and its officers. Our compliance team will be in touch with specific requirements.

In the meantime, please do not respond to any correspondence from GlobalFreight or their solicitors without consulting us first. If you receive any further threats or communications, please forward them to David immediately.

We look forward to speaking on Monday.

With kind regards,

**Victoria Hartwell**
