# AfrexAI Real Estate Outreach Emails

## INITIAL OUTREACH

### Email 1 — The Speed Test

Subject: I submitted a lead on {{BROKERAGE_NAME}}'s site last Tuesday

Hey {{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

I filled out the contact form on your website last week just to see what would happen. It took {{RESPONSE_TIME}} before I heard back. In that window, the average buyer has already reached out to two other brokerages.

We build AI agents that respond to every inbound lead in under 90 seconds, qualify them, and route them to the right agent on your team. We only get paid when your revenue actually goes up. No uplift, no payout.

Would love to show you what that looks like for a {{AGENT_COUNT}}-agent shop in {{CITY}}. Here is my calendar if you have 30 minutes this week: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

### Email 2 — The Zillow Leak

Subject: {{BROKERAGE_NAME}} is probably losing money on Zillow leads

{{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

Most brokerages in {{CITY}} convert somewhere between 1 and 3 percent of their Zillow leads. Not because the leads are bad, but because nobody follows up fast enough or long enough. The lead comes in, gets a call, maybe a text, then falls into a spreadsheet and dies.

We plug AI agents into your existing flow that nurture every single lead automatically. They text, email, and re-engage on a cadence that actually converts. And we tie our fee directly to the revenue increase we create. If we do not move the needle, you pay nothing.

Worth a conversation? https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

CTO, AfrexAI


### Email 3 — The Agent Accountability Gap

Subject: Quick question about your {{AGENT_COUNT}} agents in {{CITY}}

{{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

When a lead comes into {{BROKERAGE_NAME}}, do you actually know which agent got it, how fast they responded, and whether they followed up? Most brokers I talk to are honest that they do not. It is not a people problem, it is a systems problem.

We deploy AI agents that handle the first touch, qualify the lead, and hand it off warm. Your agents only talk to people who are actually ready. We track everything and you only pay us if revenue goes up. Literally zero risk.

I would love to walk you through how this works for brokerages your size. Grab a time here: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

CTO, AfrexAI


### Email 4 — The Listing Reference

Subject: Saw {{RECENT_LISTING_ADDRESS}} just closed, congrats

{{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

Nice work on {{RECENT_LISTING_ADDRESS}}. {{LISTING_DETAIL — e.g. "Looked like it moved fast for that price point in {{CITY}}."}}

I am curious though. For every deal like that one, how many leads slipped through because nobody followed up in time? We work with brokerages in markets like {{CITY}} where the answer is usually "more than we want to admit."

We build AI agents that make sure no lead goes cold. Our model is simple: we share in the revenue uplift we create. If there is no uplift, there is no payout. Would love to show you how it works. https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

CTO, AfrexAI


### Email 5 — The Website Gap

Subject: Something I noticed on {{BROKERAGE_NAME}}'s website

{{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

I was looking at your site and noticed {{SPECIFIC_INEFFICIENCY — e.g. "your contact form does not have any automated response" or "there is no way for a visitor to get an instant answer about a listing" or "your IDX search sends people to a dead end with no capture"}}. That is not a knock on your team. Almost every brokerage site has this problem.

The issue is that every visitor who leaves without engaging is a potential commission walking out the door. We drop an AI agent onto your site that engages visitors in real time, captures their info, and qualifies them before your agents ever pick up the phone.

We only charge based on the actual revenue increase we generate. No uplift, no payout. Totally happy to do a quick 30 minute walkthrough: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

## FOLLOW-UP EMAILS

### Follow-Up 1 — The Bump (3 days after initial)

Subject: Re: {{ORIGINAL_SUBJECT_LINE}}

{{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

Just floating this back up. I know you are busy running a brokerage with {{AGENT_COUNT}} agents so I will keep this short.

We help brokerages in {{CITY}} convert more of the leads they are already getting using AI agents. You only pay if revenue goes up. That is the whole pitch.

If the timing is better next week, grab any slot here: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

CTO, AfrexAI


### Follow-Up 2 — The Data Drop (7 days after initial)

Subject: Re: {{ORIGINAL_SUBJECT_LINE}}

{{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

One quick stat that might be relevant. Brokerages that respond to web leads in under 2 minutes convert at 4x the rate of those that respond in 30 minutes. Most teams we audit are somewhere in the 4 to 8 hour range.

Our AI agents close that gap to under 90 seconds. And since we tie our compensation to your revenue increase, there is genuinely no downside to trying it. If we fail, you pay nothing.

Happy to show you in 30 minutes: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Kalin Smolichki
CTO, AfrexAI


### Follow-Up 3 — The Breakup (14 days after initial)

Subject: Should I close your file?

{{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

I have reached out a couple of times about helping {{BROKERAGE_NAME}} convert more leads using AI. I do not want to be that person who keeps emailing, so I will assume the timing is off and leave it here.

If things change and you want to explore a model where you only pay when revenue actually increases, my calendar is always open: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Either way, hope {{CITY}} market treats you well this year.

CTO, AfrexAI


### Follow-Up 4 — The Social Proof (5 days after initial)

Subject: Re: {{ORIGINAL_SUBJECT_LINE}}

{{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

Wanted to share something quick. We recently started working with a {{SIMILAR_SIZE}} agent brokerage in {{NEARBY_MARKET}} and within the first 60 days they saw a {{PERCENTAGE}} increase in lead-to-appointment conversion. The only thing that changed was adding our AI agents to their existing flow.

The part that made them say yes was the same thing I mentioned before. No uplift, no payout. They risked nothing.

Would love to explore whether we can do the same for {{BROKERAGE_NAME}}: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

CTO, AfrexAI


### Follow-Up 5 — The Review Reference (10 days after initial)

Subject: Saw {{REVIEWER_NAME}}'s review of {{BROKERAGE_NAME}}

{{BROKER_FIRST_NAME}},

I came across a recent review where {{REVIEWER_NAME_OR_PARAPHRASE}} mentioned {{REVIEW_DETAIL — e.g. "how responsive your team was" or "a great experience with one of your agents"}}. That kind of feedback is hard to earn.

Now imagine every single lead getting that same level of attention from the first second they reach out. That is what our AI agents do. They make sure nobody falls through the cracks so your best agents can focus on closing.

And again, we only get paid when your numbers go up. Zero risk. Here is my calendar: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min
