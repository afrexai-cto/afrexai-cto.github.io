**Effective Date:** _______________

---

## 1. Purpose

This Agreement establishes a performance-based partnership in which AfrexAI provides AI-powered lead qualification, automated follow-up, and conversion analytics to Brokerage. AfrexAI is compensated solely from the incremental revenue it helps generate — if there is no measurable uplift, there is no performance fee.

---

## 2. Services

AfrexAI shall provide the following services ("Services"):

1. **AI Lead Qualification** — Automated scoring and classification of inbound leads using natural language processing and behavioral analysis
2. **Automated Follow-Up** — AI-driven nurture sequences via SMS, email, and/or chat to engage and qualify leads before agent handoff
3. **Conversion Analytics** — Attribution tracking, monthly performance reporting, and ROI analysis per the Attribution Architecture (Exhibit A)
4. **CRM Integration** — Connection to Brokerage's CRM system for seamless lead tagging and activity tracking

## 3. Baseline Measurement

### 3.1 Baseline Period
