## "We already have a CRM"

Great, we are not replacing your CRM. We plug into it. The problem is never the software, it is that agents do not use it consistently. Our AI agents log every interaction automatically so your CRM actually has accurate data in it for the first time. And since we only get paid on revenue uplift, there is zero risk in letting us prove it.

## "My agents won't use AI"

They do not have to. That is the whole point. The AI handles the parts your agents hate doing anyway: first response, follow-up, qualification, and data entry. Your agents just get warm, qualified leads handed to them ready to close. Most agents love it once they see their pipeline fill up without them doing the grunt work.

## "How do you measure uplift?"

We baseline your current conversion metrics before we start: lead volume, response time, lead-to-appointment rate, and lead-to-close rate by source. Then we track the same numbers with our AI agents in place. The delta is the uplift and it is all visible to you in a shared dashboard. No black boxes.

## "What if it doesn't work?"

Then you pay nothing. That is the entire model. We share in the revenue increase we create. If there is no increase, there is no payment. We take on all the risk because we are confident in what our AI agents deliver. You keep your current setup, nothing changes, and you lose nothing.

## "We tried automation before"

I hear that a lot and it usually means someone set up a drip campaign three years ago that sent the same generic email to every lead. That is not what we do. Our AI agents have real conversations, adapt to what the lead says, and know when to hand off to a human. It is the difference between a recorded voicemail and an actual phone call. And again, if it does not work, you do not pay.

## "Our leads are fine"

Your leads might be great. The question is how many of them are you actually converting? Most brokerages we audit are converting 1 to 3 percent of their inbound leads. That means 97 out of every 100 people who raised their hand got dropped somewhere in the process. We do not change your leads, we just make sure fewer of them fall through the cracks. No uplift, no payout.

## "Revenue share sounds complicated"

It is actually the simplest model out there. We measure your numbers before we start. We measure them after. If they go up, we share a percentage of the increase. If they do not go up, you pay zero. No retainers, no setup fees, no long-term contracts. We only win when you win.

## "I don't want to share my data"

Totally understand that concern. We do not need access to anything sensitive. We work with the same lead data your CRM already has: names, contact info, and interaction history. We do not sell data, we do not share it, and we sign whatever NDA or data agreement makes you comfortable. Our business model depends on your trust, so protecting your data is not optional for us, it is existential.
