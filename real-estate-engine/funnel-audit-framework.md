# AfrexAI Brokerage Lead Funnel Audit Framework

## Overview

This framework provides a systematic method for auditing a real estate brokerage's lead funnel. The goal is to identify revenue leaks, quantify their impact, and map each gap to an AfrexAI solution. Every audit should produce a clear before/after picture that justifies the revenue share model.

## Pre-Audit Information Gathering

Before the audit begins, collect the following from the brokerage:

1. Number of active agents
2. Monthly lead volume (all sources combined)
3. Current lead sources and approximate split
4. CRM system in use (if any)
5. Average transaction value in their market
6. Current estimated lead-to-close conversion rate
7. Monthly marketing spend on lead generation
8. Who manages incoming leads (broker, admin, individual agents)

## Audit Area 1: Website Lead Response Time

How to test: Submit a lead through the brokerage website. Start a timer. Record how long it takes to receive any response (email, text, call). Repeat at different times of day and on weekends.

What to look for: Response time over 5 minutes is a problem. Over 30 minutes is a crisis. No response at all is more common than brokers think.

The problem: Leads go cold fast. Research shows that responding within 5 minutes makes you 21x more likely to qualify a lead compared to responding in 30 minutes. Most brokerages respond in 4 to 8 hours. Many weekend and evening leads get no response until Monday morning.

Revenue impact estimate: For a brokerage generating 100 leads per month with a 2% conversion rate and $10,000 average commission, even a 1% improvement in conversion (from 2% to 3%) represents $10,000 per month in additional revenue.

How AfrexAI fixes it: Our AI agents respond to every inbound lead in under 90 seconds, 24/7/365. The response is personalized, conversational, and immediately begins qualifying the lead. No human intervention required for first contact.

Expected improvement: 2x to 4x improvement in lead-to-appointment conversion from speed alone.

## Audit Area 2: Follow-Up Cadence

How to test: After receiving the initial response from the brokerage, track all subsequent follow-up attempts over 30 days. Count the number of touches, note the channels used (call, text, email), and record the timing between each.

What to look for: Most brokerages make 1 to 2 follow-up attempts before giving up. Best practice is 8 to 12 touches over 30 days across multiple channels.

The problem: Agents are busy showing homes and closing deals. Follow-up on cold or lukewarm leads is the first thing that gets dropped. The leads that need the most nurturing get the least attention.

Revenue impact estimate: 80% of sales require 5 or more follow-up contacts. If a brokerage is only making 1 to 2 attempts, they are abandoning roughly 60% of leads that would have eventually converted with proper nurturing. On 100 leads per month, that could represent 3 to 5 additional closings per month.

How AfrexAI fixes it: AI agents execute a multi-channel follow-up sequence (text, email, re-engagement) on every lead automatically. The cadence is optimized based on lead behavior and response patterns. No lead is ever abandoned.

Expected improvement: 30% to 50% increase in lead engagement rates. Significant reduction in "dead" leads that were actually just under-nurtured.

---

## Audit Area 3: Lead Routing

How to test: Ask the broker how leads are assigned. Common answers include round robin, geographic territory, whoever answers the phone first, or "I just send them out." Ask what happens when the assigned agent does not respond.

What to look for: No clear routing rules. No fallback when the assigned agent is unavailable. Leads sitting in a queue with no owner. High-value leads going to new or underperforming agents.

The problem: Bad lead routing means the wrong agent gets the lead, or nobody gets it at all. This creates delays, dropped leads, and frustration for both agents and prospects.

Revenue impact estimate: Misrouted or unassigned leads can account for 10 to 20% of total lead volume. If even half of those would have converted with proper handling, the revenue impact is substantial.

How AfrexAI fixes it: AI agents qualify and score every lead before routing. Leads are matched to agents based on expertise, availability, and historical conversion rates. If the assigned agent does not engage within a set window, the lead is automatically escalated or reassigned.

Expected improvement: 15 to 25% reduction in lead leakage from routing failures.

## Audit Area 4: CRM Usage

How to test: Ask what CRM they use. Then ask how many of their agents actually log activity in it daily. Ask to see a sample lead record. Look for notes, activity history, and pipeline stage accuracy.

What to look for: CRM exists but is underutilized. Agents enter leads but do not update them. Pipeline stages are inaccurate. No reporting is pulled from the CRM. Some agents use their own spreadsheets or phone contacts instead.

The problem: A CRM that is not used consistently is worse than no CRM at all because it creates a false sense of organization. The broker thinks leads are being managed. They are not.

Revenue impact estimate: Poor CRM hygiene means the broker has no visibility into pipeline health, cannot forecast revenue, and cannot identify which agents are underperforming until it is too late.

How AfrexAI fixes it: Our AI agents log every interaction automatically. Every call, text, email, and status change is recorded without the agent needing to do anything. The broker gets a real-time dashboard showing actual pipeline activity, not what agents remember to enter.

Expected improvement: Near 100% data capture rate. Accurate pipeline visibility for the first time.

---

## Audit Area 5: Nurture Sequences

How to test: Ask if the brokerage has any automated email or text sequences for leads that are not ready to transact immediately. Ask to see them. Check if they are actually running.

What to look for: No nurture sequences at all (most common). Sequences that were set up once and never updated. Generic drip campaigns that send the same content to every lead regardless of their situation.

The problem: The average home buyer takes 6 to 12 months from first inquiry to purchase. Without nurture, the brokerage loses every lead that is not ready to buy right now. They spend money to generate the lead and then let it die.

Revenue impact estimate: Long-term nurture leads represent 60 to 70% of total lead volume. Even converting 5% of nurtured leads that would otherwise be lost can represent significant monthly revenue.

How AfrexAI fixes it: AI agents run personalized, adaptive nurture sequences. The content and cadence adjust based on lead behavior. When a nurtured lead shows buying signals (increased engagement, market activity), the AI re-qualifies and routes them to an agent as a warm handoff.

Expected improvement: 10 to 20% of previously "dead" leads re-engaged and converted over 6 to 12 months.

## Audit Area 6: Conversion Tracking

How to test: Ask the broker what their lead-to-close conversion rate is. Then ask how they calculate it. Ask what their cost per lead is. Ask what their cost per closing is.

What to look for: The broker does not know these numbers. Or they have a rough guess but no actual data. They know how much they spend on Zillow but not what it produces. They cannot tell you which lead source has the best ROI.

The problem: Without conversion tracking, the brokerage cannot optimize spend, cannot identify what is working, and cannot hold agents accountable for performance. They are flying blind.

Revenue impact estimate: Brokerages without conversion tracking typically overspend on low-performing lead sources by 20 to 40% while underfunding high-performing ones.

How AfrexAI fixes it: Every lead is tracked from source to close. The broker gets clear visibility into cost per lead, cost per appointment, and cost per closing by source. AI agents tag and attribute every interaction so the data is clean and reliable.

Expected improvement: 20 to 30% improvement in marketing ROI through better allocation of spend to high-performing sources.

---

## Audit Area 7: Lead Sources

How to test: Ask the broker to list all their lead sources and estimate the monthly volume from each. Common sources include Zillow, Realtor.com, their own website, social media, referrals, open houses, and sign calls.

What to look for: Over-reliance on one paid source (usually Zillow). No organic lead generation strategy. Website generates minimal leads. No system for capturing referral leads. Inconsistent tracking across sources.

The problem: Paid lead sources are expensive and getting more competitive. Brokerages that depend on a single source are vulnerable to price increases and algorithm changes. Meanwhile, their own website and past client database are untapped goldmines.

Revenue impact estimate: Diversifying lead sources and activating owned channels (website, database) can reduce cost per lead by 30 to 50% while increasing total volume.

How AfrexAI fixes it: AI agents can be deployed across all channels simultaneously. Website chat, social media DM responses, database re-engagement, and review generation all run in parallel. Each source is tracked independently so the broker can see true ROI.

Expected improvement: 20 to 40% increase in total lead volume with lower blended cost per lead.

---

## Audit Area 8: Agent Accountability

How to test: Ask the broker how they track individual agent performance. Ask what happens when an agent consistently fails to follow up on leads. Ask if they have regular pipeline review meetings.

What to look for: No individual performance tracking. The broker knows who their top producers are but not why. Underperforming agents receive the same lead volume as top performers. No consequences for dropped leads.

The problem: Without accountability, there is no mechanism for improvement. Good agents subsidize bad ones. The broker distributes leads equally rather than based on merit. High-value leads get wasted on agents who will not follow up.

Revenue impact estimate: Redirecting leads from bottom-quartile performers to top-quartile performers can improve overall conversion by 25 to 40% without generating a single additional lead.

How AfrexAI fixes it: AI agents provide objective data on every agent's response time, follow-up rate, and conversion performance. The broker gets a leaderboard with real numbers, not gut feelings. Lead routing can be adjusted based on actual performance data.

Expected improvement: 15 to 30% improvement in overall brokerage conversion through performance-based lead distribution.

## Audit Scoring Template

After completing all eight areas, score each on a 1 to 5 scale:

1 = No system in place
2 = System exists but rarely used
3 = System used inconsistently
4 = System used consistently with minor gaps
5 = Fully optimized

Scores of 1 to 3 represent immediate opportunities for AfrexAI deployment. Present findings as a simple table showing current score, revenue impact, and projected improvement with AfrexAI.

## Presenting the Audit

The audit should be delivered as a conversation, not a report. Walk the broker through each finding and let them react. The goal is not to make them feel bad about their operation. The goal is to help them see the revenue they are leaving on the table and show them a zero-risk way to capture it.

Always close with the revenue share model: "We only get paid when your numbers go up. If we do not deliver, you pay nothing. The audit we just did shows where the money is. Let us go get it together."
