### EMAIL 1: TEIFKE REAL ESTATE

TO: Matthew Teifke / Alex Coffman — teifkerealestate.com (find via LinkedIn or site contact)
SUBJECT: Quick revenue question about Teifke Real Estate

BODY:

Hey Matthew,

I was on teifkerealestate.com and noticed there is no live chat or AI assistant on the site. For a brokerage with 30+ agents in Austin, that means after-hours leads from your site are just sitting in a form until someone gets back to them.

Here is the math that caught my attention. Average Austin home is around $550K. At 3% commission that is $16,500 per closed deal. If an AI assistant on your site converts just 2 additional deals per month by responding instantly to leads at 10pm or on weekends, that is an extra $396,000 per year in commission revenue for your brokerage.

We built an AI system that does exactly this and we only get paid out of the incremental revenue it generates. No uplift, no payout. Zero risk on your side.

### EMAIL 2: MIHARA & ASSOCIATES

TO: Mihara & Associates — miharaandassociates.com (find owner via LinkedIn)
SUBJECT: Quick revenue question about Mihara & Associates

BODY:

Hi there,

I pulled up miharaandassociates.com and noticed the site is built on AgentFire with no AI chat or instant lead engagement. For a brokerage that grew from 7 to 68 agents on the back of strong marketing, the gap between driving traffic and actually capturing those leads in real time is costing you deals.

Tampa average home price is around $400K. That is $12,000 in commission per close. If an AI follow-up system converts just 2 more leads per month into closings, that is $288,000 per year in new revenue your team is currently leaving on the table.

We only take a percentage of the new revenue we generate. No uplift, no payout. Your downside is literally zero.

### EMAIL 3: MONUMENT REALTY (DALLAS)

TO: Tiffany & Eddie Burns — Monument Realty Dallas
SUBJECT: Quick revenue question about Monument Realty

BODY:

Hey Tiffany,

I checked out Monument Realty's site and noticed there is no chat widget and the lead capture is basically a standard contact form. With 25 agents, every lead that fills out that form and does not hear back within 5 minutes is already shopping with someone else.

Dallas average home runs about $450K. At 3% that is $13,500 per deal. If instant AI follow-up closes just 2 more deals a month for your team, that is $324,000 a year in additional commission revenue.

We built a system that handles this and we only get paid from the extra revenue it creates. No uplift, no payout.

### EMAIL 4: SPYGLASS REALTY

TO: Ryan Rodenbeck — spyglassrealty.com
SUBJECT: Quick revenue question about Spyglass Realty

BODY:

Hey Ryan,

I was on spyglassrealty.com and saw the "Click this button to talk to a real estate expert" CTA. That is a great idea but it routes to a manual process. Your reviews are incredible and your agents clearly deliver once they are in conversation, but the gap is what happens before that first conversation starts, especially nights and weekends.

At $550K average home price in Austin, each deal is worth about $16,500 in commission. If AI-powered instant response converts just 2 more leads per month into closings, that is $396,000 per year your boutique brokerage is not capturing right now.

We only take a cut of the incremental revenue we generate. No uplift, no payout. You keep everything if it does not work.

### EMAIL 5: MAINFRAME REAL ESTATE

TO: Mainframe Real Estate — mainframere.com (find founder/owner via LinkedIn)
SUBJECT: Quick revenue question about Mainframe Real Estate

BODY:

Hi,

I was looking at mainframere.com and noticed the site has a home valuation request form but no instant chat or AI engagement. For the top independent brokerage in downtown Orlando, every seller who fills out that valuation form and waits hours for a response is a potential listing lost to a competitor who replied faster.

Orlando average home is around $400K. At 3% commission that is $12,000 per deal. If instant AI follow-up on your valuation requests and buyer inquiries converts just 2 more deals per month, that is $288,000 per year in new revenue.

Our model is simple. We only get paid from the revenue we generate. No uplift, no payout. There is no cost if it does not produce results.
