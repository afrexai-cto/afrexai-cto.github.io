### New Prospects: 10 US-Based (IDs 021-030)
All US mid-market, 50-10,000+ employees:

### Follow-Up Queue
No active sequences. All 30 prospects at RESEARCHED stage.

### ⚠️ Critical Flag: Geographic Mismatch
**18 of original 20 prospects (001-020) are UK-based.** Target market is US-ONLY per MEMORY.md rules. Today's batch (021-030) corrects this — all US-based. Recommend deprioritizing IDs 001-008, 011-020 or moving to a separate UK pipeline if ever needed.

### Blockers
1. **DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)** — still not configured. Zero emails can be sent.
2. **Vault access** — isolated sessions can't reach encrypted credentials. Need fix for email checking.
3. **Contact details** — all 30 prospects need verified names + email addresses before any outreach.

### Next Actions
- Find verified contacts for US prospects 021-030 (priority)
- Get DNS records configured (escalate to Kalin)
- Fix vault access for isolated agent sessions
