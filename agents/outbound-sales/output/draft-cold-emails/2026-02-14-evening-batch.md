## 021 — Polsinelli PC (Legal, Kansas City MO)

**To:** CTO/CIO, Polsinelli PC
**Subject:** Healthcare docs are burying your teams

Hi [First Name],

Polsinelli's healthcare regulatory practice is one of the strongest in the Am Law 100 — but that also means your teams are processing thousands of compliance documents per engagement.

We built an AI document automation system that cuts regulatory review turnaround by 60%+ for firms like yours. Not a chatbot — production-grade automation that plugs into existing workflows.

Worth a 20-minute call to see if it fits?

## 022 — Seyfarth Shaw LLP (Legal, Chicago IL)

**To:** Director of Innovation/CIO, Seyfarth Shaw LLP
**Subject:** Seyfarth Lean + AI = next level

Hi [First Name],

Seyfarth Lean proved your firm believes in process innovation before it was fashionable. AI-powered document automation is the natural next step — same philosophy, 10x the leverage.

We're helping law firms automate document review, due diligence, and compliance workflows. For a firm that already thinks in process terms, the ROI conversation is straightforward.

## 023 — Clark Hill PLC (Legal, Detroit MI)

**To:** CTO/CIO, Clark Hill PLC
**Subject:** Growing fast creates doc bottlenecks

Hi [First Name],

Clark Hill's expansion from regional to national firm is impressive — but growth like that creates document processing bottlenecks that multiply with every new office.

We automate document review and due diligence for mid-market law firms. The firms that scale AI alongside their growth don't hit the wall at 15 offices.

Quick call to see if this is on your radar?

## 024 — CrossCountry Mortgage (Financial Services, Cleveland OH)

**To:** CTO/VP Engineering, CrossCountry Mortgage
**Subject:** 100K+ loans = millions in doc processing

Hi [First Name],

CrossCountry is one of the top 3 retail mortgage lenders in the US — which means your teams are touching hundreds of thousands of documents per year across origination, underwriting, and compliance.

We built AI document automation specifically for high-volume financial services. One client cut underwriting doc review time by 50% in the first quarter.

Worth 20 minutes to see the numbers?

## 025 — Ceridian / Dayforce (HR Tech, Minneapolis MN)

**To:** VP of AI/Head of Product, Dayforce
**Subject:** Onboarding docs are the next frontier

Hi [First Name],

Dayforce already automates the HR workflow — but onboarding and compliance documentation is still a manual bottleneck for most of your mid-market clients.

We're building AI-powered document processing that plugs into HCM platforms. For Dayforce, this could be a product enhancement or a partnership play.

## 026 — Ryan Specialty Group (Insurance, Chicago IL)

**To:** CTO/Head of Technology, Ryan Specialty Group
**Subject:** E&S submissions take too long

Hi [First Name],

Specialty and E&S underwriting is one of the most document-intensive processes in insurance. Every submission involves complex risk analysis across dozens of documents.

We built AI that cuts submission review time by 50%+ for specialty insurers. For a firm growing as fast as Ryan Specialty, that's millions in operational savings.

## 027 — Brasfield & Gorrie (Construction, Birmingham AL)

**To:** VP of Technology/CIO, Brasfield & Gorrie
**Subject:** $5B in projects, still manual compliance?

Hi [First Name],

Brasfield & Gorrie runs $5B+ in projects across the Southeast. At that scale, safety compliance documentation and project reporting shouldn't be manual — but at most contractors, it still is.

We automate safety compliance tracking and project documentation for top-tier contractors. The ROI is immediate: fewer compliance gaps, faster reporting, less admin overhead.

20 minutes to walk through it?

## 028 — Hensel Phelps (Construction, Greeley CO)

**To:** Director of Innovation/VP Technology, Hensel Phelps
**Subject:** Design-build = doc overload

Hi [First Name],

Hensel Phelps' design-build model is a competitive advantage — but it also generates massive pre-construction documentation that most teams process manually.

We automate proposal review, compliance documentation, and project tracking for contractors. For an employee-owned firm that values innovation, this is low-hanging fruit.

Worth a conversation?

## 029 — Marcus & Millichap (Real Estate, Calabasas CA)

**To:** CTO/VP Technology, Marcus & Millichap
**Subject:** 2000 brokers, thousands of reports

Hi [First Name],

Marcus & Millichap's 2,000+ brokers generate thousands of property valuations and market reports every quarter. Most of that assembly is still manual.

We built AI that automates property report creation — pulling data, generating narratives, formatting to brand standards. Clients see 70% reduction in report creation time.

## 030 — Insight Global (Staffing, Atlanta GA)

**To:** CTO/VP Engineering, Insight Global
**Subject:** 60K placements/year needs AI matching

Hi [First Name],

Insight Global places 60,000+ consultants per year. At that volume, even small improvements in candidate matching and onboarding doc automation translate to millions in savings.

We automate candidate-to-role matching and onboarding documentation for high-volume staffing firms. The math is simple: faster placements, fewer compliance gaps, better margins.
