## 031 — Husch Blackwell LLP (Legal)

**To:** CIO/Chief Innovation Officer
**Subject:** After the Legalweek win

Hi [First Name],

Congrats on the Legalweek AI finalist nod — that's not easy to earn.

Most firms stop at the pilot stage. The hard part is moving from "interesting experiment" to production workflows that actually reduce associate hours on document review.

We've built AI document automation specifically for legal — compliance review, due diligence, regulatory filings. Firms using it report 60%+ reduction in manual review time.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough be worth your time this week?

## 032 — Kforce Inc (Recruitment)

**To:** CTO/VP Technology
**Subject:** Faster placements, same team

Hi [First Name],

Kforce fills thousands of tech and finance roles annually. Every day a position stays open costs your clients real money.

We've built AI that automates candidate matching and compliance documentation — the two biggest bottlenecks between "submitted" and "placed." Staffing firms using it are cutting time-to-fill by 35%.

Worth a quick call to see if this fits your roadmap?

## 033 — Robins Kaplan LLP (Legal)

**To:** CIO/Director of IT
**Subject:** Cut e-discovery costs 60%

Hi [First Name],

Complex litigation means complex document review. Robins Kaplan's reputation is built on winning the hard cases — but the doc review grind eats into margins on every matter.

We've built AI specifically for litigation document analysis. It doesn't replace your attorneys' judgment — it surfaces the relevant docs 60% faster so they can focus on strategy.

Interested in seeing how it works on a real dataset?

## 034 — Sundt Construction (Construction)

**To:** VP of Technology/CIO
**Subject:** Safety compliance on autopilot

Hi [First Name],

Employee-owned companies feel efficiency gains differently — they go straight to the people doing the work.

Sundt runs $2B+ in projects across the Southwest. Every one of those has safety documentation, compliance filings, and progress reports that someone is assembling manually. AI automates that assembly — same accuracy, fraction of the time.

Would 20 minutes be worth exploring this?

## 035 — Whiting-Turner Contracting (Construction)

**To:** VP of Technology/Innovation Director
**Subject:** Next step for Tech Excellence

Hi [First Name],

I noticed Whiting-Turner has a dedicated Technology Excellence practice — that's rare in construction and says a lot about your culture.

The next frontier: AI-powered project documentation and safety compliance that scales across your $8B+ portfolio. We've built automation that handles the document-heavy workflows your teams deal with daily — RFIs, submittals, compliance filings.

Worth a conversation about what that looks like in practice?

## 036 — CBRE Group (Real Estate)

**To:** VP of Technology/PropTech Lead
**Subject:** AI for $148B in assets

Hi [First Name],

At CBRE's scale, even a 5% improvement in valuation report turnaround time saves millions in analyst hours annually.

We've built AI document automation for commercial real estate — lease abstractions, property valuations, due diligence packages. The output is analyst-quality at machine speed.

Given CBRE's portfolio, the ROI math is compelling. Can I show you the numbers in 15 minutes?

## 037 — Jackson Lewis PC (Legal)

**To:** CIO/Director of Technology
**Subject:** Compliance docs at 60 offices

Hi [First Name],

Jackson Lewis handles employment compliance for thousands of employers across 60+ offices. That's an enormous volume of policy documents, handbooks, and regulatory filings.

We've built AI that automates compliance document review and generation — purpose-built for high-volume employment law. Firms using it cut manual review time by 60% while improving consistency across offices.

Would a short demo be useful?

## 038 — Skanska USA (Construction)

**To:** VP of Innovation/Digital Lead
**Subject:** Digital-first meets AI-first

Hi [First Name],

Skanska's Swedish heritage is digital-forward by nature. The US division's $7B project pipeline is exactly the kind of scale where AI-powered safety compliance and project documentation automation pays for itself in weeks.

We automate the document-heavy workflows in construction — safety filings, project reports, compliance submissions. Same rigor, fraction of the time.

Worth 15 minutes to explore the fit?

## 039 — Paylocity (HR Tech)

**To:** VP of AI/Head of Product
**Subject:** AI onboarding at scale

Hi [First Name],

Paylocity serves 36K+ clients. Every one of those runs onboarding workflows with document collection, verification, and compliance checks. Most of that is still manual.

We've built AI that automates onboarding document processing — employment verification, I-9 compliance, benefits enrollment paperwork. It plugs into existing HCM workflows and handles the document grind.

Interested in seeing how this complements Paylocity's platform?

## 040 — Newmark Group (Real Estate)

**To:** CTO/Head of Technology
**Subject:** Due diligence in half the time

Hi [First Name],

Newmark's capital markets team assembles hundreds of due diligence packages annually. Each one involves pulling, reviewing, and compiling documents from multiple sources — a process that's still largely manual.

We've built AI that automates due diligence document assembly and review for commercial real estate. Firms using it cut report creation time by 70%.

Worth a quick call to see if this fits your workflow?
