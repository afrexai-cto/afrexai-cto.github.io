## 041 — Armanino LLP (San Ramon, CA)
**To:** Matt Armanino <matt.armanino@armanino.com>
**Subject:** Tax season bottleneck
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Matt,

Armanino's consulting arm already pushes tech boundaries — but I'd bet your audit and tax teams still have analysts toggling between PDFs, spreadsheets, and workpapers manually during busy season.

We built AI agents that automate document intake, cross-reference, and preliminary review for mid-market accounting firms. One firm cut their per-engagement review time by 40% in the first quarter.

Worth a 20-minute look?

## 042 — Whitley Penn (Fort Worth, TX)
**To:** Larry Autrey <larry.autrey@whitleypenn.com>
**Subject:** Scaling without headcount
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Larry,

Texas accounting firms are growing fast — but hiring experienced CPAs isn't keeping pace. Whitley Penn's multi-office footprint means the pressure multiplies every busy season.

We deploy AI agents that handle document processing, engagement letter generation, and compliance checks — work that currently eats 20+ hours per engagement. Your people focus on advisory, the agents handle the grind.

Happy to show you how it works in practice:

## 043 — Withum (Princeton, NJ)
**To:** Pat Walsh <pat.walsh@withum.com>
**Subject:** Withum's next efficiency lever
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Pat,

Withum's been smart about growth — strategic acquisitions, vertical specialization. But every acquisition adds legacy processes and document formats that don't talk to each other.

Our AI agents standardize and automate document intake across different systems — think of it as a universal translator for your workpapers and client files. Firms using it recovered 15-25 hours per week in admin time.

## 044 — Citrin Cooperman (New York, NY)
**To:** Alan Goldenberg <alan.goldenberg@citrincooperman.com>
**Subject:** NYC firms are automating this
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Alan,

New York's top accounting firms are racing to embed AI into their audit and tax workflows. The ones moving now are locking in efficiency gains before busy season 2027.

We build AI agents specifically for accounting — document review, compliance checking, client onboarding automation. Not generic chatbots — purpose-built for the workflows your teams run every day.

## 045 — Carr Riggs & Ingram (Enterprise, AL)
**To:** Bill Carr <bill.carr@cricpa.com>
**Subject:** Busy season without the burnout
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Bill,

CRI's growth across the Southeast means more clients, more engagements, and more document processing — but your team's bandwidth doesn't scale the same way.

We deploy AI agents that handle the repetitive work: document intake, data extraction from tax forms, preliminary compliance checks. Your people stay on advisory and client relationships. One firm our size saved 300+ hours in their first busy season.

## 046 — Sikich (Naperville, IL)
**To:** Chris Geier <chris.geier@sikich.com>
**Subject:** Sikich + AI agents
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Chris,

Sikich already bridges accounting and technology consulting — which means you see the gap between what AI could do for your clients and what it could do internally.

We build AI agents for accounting operations: document processing, engagement management, compliance automation. Not a SaaS platform you need to train people on — agents that plug into your existing workflow and start producing immediately.

## 047 — Katz Sapper & Miller (Indianapolis, IN)
**To:** Tim Cook <tim.cook@ksmcpa.com>
**Subject:** 20 hours back per week
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Tim,

Mid-market accounting firms like KSM are doing enterprise-level work with mid-market resources. The math doesn't add up unless you automate the repetitive layers.

We deploy AI agents that handle document intake, cross-referencing, and preliminary review — the work that eats 20+ hours per week across your engagement teams. No new software to learn, no 6-month implementation.

## 048 — The Bonadio Group (Rochester, NY)
**To:** Bruce Zicari <bruce.zicari@bonadio.com>
**Subject:** Document processing at scale
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Bruce,

Bonadio's multi-practice model means your teams handle everything from audit to consulting — and every practice has its own document processing bottleneck.

We build AI agents that work across practice areas: intake, extraction, compliance checks, report drafting. Think of it as adding 3-4 experienced analysts who never sleep and never make data entry errors.

## 049 — Anchin (New York, NY)
**To:** Russell Shinsky <russell.shinsky@anchin.com>
**Subject:** What Anchin's competitors are doing
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Russell,

Three of the top 20 NYC accounting firms are already deploying AI agents for their document-heavy workflows. The early movers are seeing 30-40% time savings on compliance and audit prep.

Anchin's client-first reputation means your people should be spending time on advice, not processing. We can help shift that ratio.

## 050 — Aldrich CPAs (Portland, OR)
**To:** Jeff Lewis <jeff.lewis@aldrichadvisors.com>
**Subject:** Advisory time vs admin time
**From:** Kalin Smolichki, CTO — AfrexAI

Jeff,

The firms winning right now are the ones shifting their ratio from 60% admin / 40% advisory to the inverse. Most mid-market firms know this — the bottleneck is the document processing that keeps everyone stuck.

We deploy AI agents that handle intake, extraction, and compliance checks so your team can focus on the advisory work that actually grows the firm.
