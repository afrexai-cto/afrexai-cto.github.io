## 🚨 Blockers (CRITICAL)

1. **DNS Records NOT SET** — SPF, DKIM, DMARC all missing. Cannot send a single email. Sending now = domain reputation destruction. This is the #1 blocker for the entire outbound program.
2. **Contact details missing** — All prospects have placeholder emails (tbd@). Need real names + verified emails before any outreach.
3. **Vault inaccessible** — Cannot check email replies or send from isolated cron sessions.

## Recommendations
1. **Fix DNS immediately** — this blocks everything. Estimated 15 min of work.
2. **Source contact details** — consider Apollo.io paid plan, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, or manual research
3. **Prioritize Legal + Construction** — strongest market tailwinds per latest research
4. **Batch 4 targets needed** — running low on researched US prospects outside current verticals. Consider adding Insurance vertical.
