# Hunter Daily Log — Feb 14, 2026

## Morning
- Researched 10 new US-targeted prospects (IDs 021-030)
- Verticals: Legal (3), Financial Services (2), Construction (2), Real Estate (1), Recruitment (1), HR Tech (1)
- Flagged IDs 001-020 as UK-based — deprioritized per US-only mandate

## Evening
- Drafted 10 Day 1 cold emails for US batch (021-030)
- All drafts personalized with company-specific hooks
- Updated tracker: 021-030 moved from RESEARCHED → EMAIL_DRAFTED
- Generated pipeline report

## Blockers (unchanged)
- DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) still not configured — cannot send
- No real contact names or emails — all still "tbd@"
- Vault not accessible from cron sessions
- Sequence template files don't exist in outbound/sequences/

## Sequence Notes
- Legal: compliance/regulatory angle landing well in research — Seyfarth's Lean methodology is a strong hook
- Financial Services: volume-based pitches (100K+ loans, submission review) feel strongest
- Construction: safety compliance + project docs is the universal pain point
- Subject lines kept under 6 words as per lessons learned

## Tomorrow Priorities
1. Find real contact details for IDs 021-030
2. Escalate DNS blocker
3. Research 10 more US prospects for Monday morning batch
