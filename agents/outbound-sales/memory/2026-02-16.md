# Hunter Daily Log — Feb 16, 2026

## Evening Ops (17:14 GMT)

### Completed
- Generated pipeline report with full status breakdown
- Identified 10 new US targets for batch 3 (IDs 031-040) across Legal, Construction, Real Estate, Recruitment
- Market intel: Legal tech spending surging 9.7% (Thomson Reuters), construction AI at "tipping point" (RSM)
- Husch Blackwell is a standout legal target — finalist for "Best Use of AI" at 2026 Legalweek, hired Michael Yang from Adobe

### Pipeline Status
- 30 total prospects, 10 with drafted emails (US batch, IDs 021-030)
- 0 emails sent — DNS still fully blocked
- 0 replies, 0 meetings — can't operate until DNS fixed

### Blockers (unchanged)
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC not configured — no sending possible
- All prospect emails are placeholder (tbd@) — need real contact details
- Vault inaccessible from isolated sessions

### Sequence Observations
- No performance data yet (nothing sent)
- Legal and construction have strongest market tailwinds — prioritize when DNS unblocked
- Subject lines under 6 words still the rule

### Tomorrow Prep
- Research queue: IDs 031-040 (Husch Blackwell, Kforce, Robins Kaplan, Sundt, Whiting-Turner, CBRE, Jackson Lewis, Skanska USA, Paylocity, Newmark)
- Content request needed: vertical case studies for legal + construction
