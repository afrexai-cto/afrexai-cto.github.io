# Hunter Daily Log — Feb 15, 2026

## Evening Ops
- Generated pipeline report — 30 total prospects, 10 US-targeted with drafts ready
- No new emails to draft (all US prospects already at EMAIL_DRAFTED)
- No RESEARCHED US prospects remaining — need to source batch 2
- Brave Search rate limited — couldn't research new prospects tonight

## Pipeline Status
- 10 US drafts queued (021-030), awaiting DNS + contact details
- 20 UK prospects deprioritized (001-020)
- $1.2M potential pipeline value, ~$24-36K realistic at 2-3% conversion
- Need 50+ US prospects minimum for meaningful outreach volume

## Blockers (UNCHANGED since Feb 14)
- DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) still not configured — CRITICAL
- No real contact names/emails for any prospect
- Vault not accessible from cron sessions
- Sequence template files still missing

## Tomorrow Priorities (Mon Feb 16)
1. Research 10 new US prospects (IDs 031-040) — Insurance, Legal, Healthcare, Construction, FinServ
2. Find actual contact details for 021-030 (LinkedIn profiles, email verification)
3. Draft Day 1 emails for any new RESEARCHED prospects
4. Escalate DNS to Kalin — this is week 1+ of being blocked

## Sequence Observations
- No send data yet — can't optimize without deliverability
- Thomson Reuters reports confirm legal industry investing heavily in tech (Jan 2026 report)
- Mid-sized firms are leading AI adoption per Clio report — validates our targeting
- Q4 2025 was record-breaking for law firms — they have budget to spend
