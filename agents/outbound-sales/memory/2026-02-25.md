### Blockers
- **Brave Search API quota exhausted** — couldn't do deep research on prospects. Used CRM data + general knowledge.
- **DNS still not configured** — SPF/DKIM/DMARC needed before any sends
- **No emails sent** — all remain drafts per protocol

### Pipeline Totals (cumulative)
- 50 total prospects tracked (IDs 001-050)
- 20 RESEARCHED (UK, deprioritized)
- 30 EMAIL_DRAFTED (IDs 021-050)
