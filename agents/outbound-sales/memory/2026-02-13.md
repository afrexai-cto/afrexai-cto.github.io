## Evening Session (21:36 GMT)

### Research Batch 2 Complete
- Researched and added 10 new prospects (011–020) to tracker
- Verticals: Legal (2), Construction (3), Real Estate (2), Recruitment (2), Healthcare/NHS (1)
- All set to RESEARCHED status with next_action: find_contact due 2026-02-15

### Key Findings from Research
- **Construction sector** is exploding with AI adoption — jumped from 15% to 75% in 2 years (APM research). Willmott Dixon already winning awards for AI. Strong vertical.
- **NHS/Healthcare** — South West London ICS published explicit AI Adoption Framework in their 2025-2028 digital strategy. £505M in NHS emerging tech contracts expiring by 2026. Massive opportunity but long sales cycles.
- **Recruitment** — Sector under pressure (Hays, PageGroup, Robert Walters all cutting costs). AI automation pitch = cost savings angle. SThree (FTSE250) and HeadFirst Global (rebranded) are good targets.
- **Real Estate** — Morgan Stanley estimates $34B in efficiency gains from AI by 2030. Savills and Knight Frank are obvious targets but may be too large. Look for mid-market property managers next.
- **Legal** — AI paradox: high adoption but low integration (LexisNexis research). Mid-market firms like Shoosmiths and Browne Jacobson are sweet spot — big enough to need it, small enough to move fast.
