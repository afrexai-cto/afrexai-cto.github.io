## Overdue Invoices
- **UNKNOWN** — QBO inaccessible. Cannot query AR aging.

## Anomalies Detected
- **[WARN]** Failed subscription charge: $120.00 recurring payment has failed 3 of last 4 attempts. Customer payment method likely expired or declined. Escalate to COO.
- **[INFO]** Feb 2026 revenue ($120.00) dramatically below monthly average ($10,577.71). Only 14 days in, but 98.9% below trend. Likely timing — major invoices (VADIS-style $12,143.00) tend to land mid-month.
- **[INFO]** QBO integration still not established. No reconciliation possible. This is day 2 of operations without full accounting access.

## ARR Tracker
- Current monthly run rate (trailing 6mo avg, excl. Feb): **$13,900.28/mo**
- Implied ARR: **$166,803.32**
- Target: **$11,000,000.00**
- Progress: **1.52%**
- Trend: → (stable — recurring invoice payments consistent at ~$12K-$16K/mo)

## Open Blockers
1. **QBO OAuth tokens missing** — Cannot reconcile, check invoices, or calculate true P&L. CRITICAL.
2. **Failing subscription** — $120.00/mo recurring charge needs payment method update.

## Month-End Check
- Not applicable — Feb 14 is not month-end.

## Housekeeping
- Input queue: empty
- MEMORY.md: updated with Stripe access confirmation and financial baseline
