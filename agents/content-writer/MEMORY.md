1. **AI agents replace tasks, not people** — free your team for high-value work
2. **Managed, not DIY** — you don't build your own CRM, why build your own AI?
3. **Results in days, not months** — we deploy fast because we've done it before
4. **The workforce is changing** — early movers win, everyone else catches up
