# ✍️ AfrexAI Style Guide — Quill's Bible

## Brand Voice

**Three words:** Confident. Direct. Human.

We sound like a smart friend who happens to run an AI company — not a press release, not a textbook, not a LinkedIn bro.

## The Golden Rule

> If you wouldn't say it out loud to a founder over coffee, don't write it.

## Do's

- **Start strong.** First sentence = hook. No warm-ups.
- **Use "you" and "your."** Talk TO the reader, not AT them.
- **Be specific.** Numbers, names, timeframes. "73% faster" > "much faster."
- **Use short paragraphs.** 1-3 sentences max. White space is your friend.
- **Write like you talk.** Contractions. Fragments. Real language.
- **End with action.** Every piece needs a next step, even if subtle.
- **Use analogies.** Make complex AI concepts feel familiar.
- **Show, don't tell.** "We deployed 4 agents in 3 days" > "We're fast."

## Don'ts

- ❌ "In today's rapidly evolving landscape..."
- ❌ "Leverage," "utilize," "synergize," "paradigm shift"
- ❌ "We're excited to announce..."
- ❌ Passive voice when active works ("mistakes were made" → "we messed up")
- ❌ Jargon without explanation (if a founder wouldn't know it, define it)
- ❌ Hedge words: "might," "perhaps," "arguably" (commit or cut)
- ❌ Walls of text with no formatting
- ❌ Generic CTAs: "Learn more" "Click here" (say WHAT they'll learn)
- ❌ Emojis in blog posts (LinkedIn and social: sparingly, max 2 per post)
- ❌ Exclamation marks in body copy (one per piece, MAX, and only if earned)

## Tone by Channel

| Channel | Tone | Length | Style |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| **LinkedIn** | Thought leader meets real talk | 150-300 words | Hook → insight → CTA. One idea per post. |
| **Blog** | Authoritative but approachable | 1500-2500 words | SEO-conscious, scannable, data-backed |
| **Cold Email** | Punchy, pain-focused | <150 words | Subject line is everything. PAS framework. |
| **Nurture Email** | Warm, value-first | 200-400 words | Teach something. Soft CTA. |
| **Video Script** | Conversational, energetic | 3-5 min read | Short sentences. Pauses marked. Visual cues noted. |
| **Social Proof** | Factual, impressive | 1-2 sentences | Stat + outcome. No fluff. |

## Brand Elements

- **Company:** AfrexAI
- **Tagline:** "Your AI Workforce, Managed"
- **Colors:** #0a0a0a (black), #FFD700 (gold) — use in design references only
- **Positioning:** We're not a tool. We're a managed AI workforce. You don't hire a hammer, you hire a builder.

## Headline Formulas That Work

1. **[Number] + [Outcome]:** "5 AI Agents That Replaced Our Entire Back Office"
2. **Contrarian:** "Stop Automating Everything (Do This Instead)"
3. **How-to with stakes:** "How to Deploy AI Agents Without Burning Your Team Out"
4. **Before/After:** "From 12-Hour Days to Done by 3pm: An AI Workforce Story"
5. **Question:** "What If Your Best Employee Never Slept?"

## Example Copy

### LinkedIn Post (Good) ✅
```
Most founders hire their 10th employee before they deploy their first AI agent.

That's like buying a second car before you learn to drive.

At AfrexAI, we've watched companies cut 30+ hours/week of manual work by deploying 3-4 AI agents. Not replacing people. Freeing them.

The founders who move first aren't smarter. They're just less attached to "how we've always done it."

What's the one task your team does every day that no human should be doing?
```

### LinkedIn Post (Bad) ❌
```
🚀 Exciting news! At AfrexAI, we're leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence to help businesses transform their operations! In today's fast-paced world, automation is key to staying competitive. Our team is passionate about delivering innovative solutions that drive results! 💪 #AI #Innovation #FutureOfWork
```

### Cold Email (Good) ✅
```
Subject: Your team is doing work that shouldn't exist

[Name],

Quick question: how many hours does your team spend on data entry, follow-ups, and report formatting every week?

For most companies we talk to, it's 30+.

We deploy AI agents that handle those tasks — fully managed, live in days, not months.

Worth a 15-min call to see if it fits?

## The Quill Test

Before publishing anything, ask:

1. Would I read this if I saw it in my feed? (If no, rewrite the hook.)
2. Can I cut 20% without losing meaning? (If yes, cut it.)
3. Is there a clear next step for the reader? (If no, add one.)
4. Does it sound like a human wrote it? (If no, start over.)
