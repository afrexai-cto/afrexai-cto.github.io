# Legora Just Hit $6B. What Every Mid-Market Law Firm Should Learn.

## H2: The Fastest Unicorn in YC History
- Legora: $6B valuation, targeting $40M ARR in legal AI
- Proves legal AI isn't speculative anymore — capital is flooding in
- Thomson Reuters report confirms: AI transforming legal, tax, accounting sectors
- But their target? AmLaw 100. Firms with $500M+ revenue.

## H2: The Mid-Market Blind Spot
- 50-500 person firms = massive underserved segment
- Same pain points as BigLaw: document review, contract management, compliance
- Fraction of the budget, zero enterprise sales attention
- These firms lose associates to burnout on work AI should handle

## H2: What Mid-Market Firms Actually Need
- Speed: deploy in days, not quarters (no 18-month "digital transformation")
- Domain awareness: agents that understand legal compliance, not generic chatbots
- Affordability: fixed pricing, not per-seat enterprise licensing
- Proof: measurable results in week one, not a roadmap presentation

## H2: Why Generic AI Tools Fail in Legal
- Compliance requirements make horizontal AI dangerous
- Legal language is domain-specific — generic models hallucinate precedents
- Firms need agents that act (redline, review, flag) not just answer questions
- Vertical AI agents retain 3-5x better than horizontal tools (Presta data)

## H2: The Verdict AI Approach
- Built for mid-market legal: compliance-aware, fast-deploying, outcome-priced
- "Week I Win" — working demo in 7 days
- Agents handle doc review, contract analysis, compliance checks autonomously
- Human-in-the-loop for edge cases — not replacement, augmentation
