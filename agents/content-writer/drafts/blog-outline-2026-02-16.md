# Why Agentic AI Succeeds Where Digital Transformation Stalled

## H2: The $1.3 Trillion Lesson
- McKinsey: 70% of digital transformation initiatives fail
- Root cause: rip-and-replace mentality, multi-year timelines, scope creep
- Companies digitized processes without fixing them — garbage in, digital garbage out
- The hangover: exec teams now skeptical of any "transformation" pitch

## H2: What Makes Agentic AI Structurally Different
- No rip-and-replace — agents layer on top of existing systems
- Outcome-based, not project-based — you deploy an agent to DO something, not "transform" something
- Autonomous execution vs. tool augmentation — agents act, they don't just recommend
- Time to value: days/weeks, not quarters/years
- Failure is cheap — kill an agent that doesn't work, spin up a new one

## H2: The Numbers Are Already In
- Salesforce: 87% of companies using AI, 54% deploying agents (not chatbots)
- Goldman Sachs + Anthropic partnership for accounting/compliance agents
- ZeroDrift: compliance agents cutting review cycles from days to hours
- Healthcare (Secai): clinical workflow agents reducing admin burden
- Finance: 40% of middle-office operations automated by EOY 2026 (TechBullion)
- Legora: $6B valuation in legal AI — market is voting with capital

## H2: What an Agent Deployment Actually Looks Like
- Pick ONE high-friction workflow (invoice processing, lead follow-up, compliance checks)
- Deploy agent with domain context (industry-specific knowledge, not generic)
- Agent runs autonomously, escalates edge cases to humans
- Week 1: measurable results. Not month 6. Week 1.
- Contrast with DT: no committee, no change management initiative, no 90-slide deck

## H2: Why Most Companies Will Still Get This Wrong
- Buying horizontal "AI platforms" instead of vertical agents
- Treating agents like chatbots (Q&A) instead of workers (autonomous execution)
- Waiting for "the right time" — competitors aren't waiting
- Over-engineering governance before deploying anything

## H2: Find Out What You're Leaking
- Transition to CTA: most companies don't know how much manual work costs them
