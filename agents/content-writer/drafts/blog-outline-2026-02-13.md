# Why Most AI Automation Projects Fail (And the 5 Things That Actually Work)

## H2: The 80% Failure Rate Nobody Talks About
- Most AI projects die in the POC phase — never reach production
- Common pattern: 3 months of tinkering, demo that works on stage, collapse in production
- The gap isn't technical. It's operational.

## H2: Mistake #1 — Automating the Wrong Things First
- Companies start with complex, high-stakes processes (bad idea)
- Start with high-volume, low-judgment tasks: data entry, follow-ups, formatting
- The "boring first" rule: automate what nobody wants to do, not what looks impressive in a pitch deck

## H2: Mistake #2 — Building Instead of Buying
- DIY AI agents = full-time maintenance commitment
- Prompt engineering is the easy part. Monitoring, error handling, edge cases — that's the job.
- Analogy: building vs hiring. You don't build employees from scratch.

## H2: Mistake #3 — No Human in the Loop
- Fully autonomous day one = recipe for disaster
- Progressive autonomy: supervised → semi-autonomous → autonomous
- Trust is earned, not configured

## H2: The 5 Patterns That Work
- **Pattern 1: Task-level deployment** — one agent, one job, measurable output
- **Pattern 2: Week-one wins** — deploy something useful in 5 business days
- **Pattern 3: Managed, not abandoned** — someone watches the agents (that's us)
- **Pattern 4: Measure in hours saved, not "AI maturity"** — real KPIs
- **Pattern 5: Expand from proof** — scale what works, kill what doesn't

## H2: What This Looks Like in Practice
- Case study structure: before state → deployment → results (30+ hrs/week recovered)
- Specific agent types: inbox triage, lead qualification, report generation, follow-up sequences
- Timeline: days to deploy, weeks to ROI
