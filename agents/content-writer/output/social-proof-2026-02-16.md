# Social Proof Snippets — 2026-02-16

## Testimonial Frameworks (Fill-in-the-Blank)

**1. The Time Recovery**
> "We were spending [X] hours a week on [task]. AfrexAI deployed an agent in [timeframe] and now it runs on autopilot. My team finally works on things that actually matter."
> — [Name], [Title] at [Company]

**2. The Skeptic Convert**
> "I'll be honest — after [previous vendor/DT project], I didn't believe any automation pitch. AfrexAI had us live in [X] days. That was [months] ago. Haven't touched the workflow since."
> — [Name], [Title] at [Company]

**3. The ROI Reveal**
> "We calculated [X] hours saved per month. At our loaded cost per hour, that's [$Y] back in the budget. The agent paid for itself in [timeframe]."
> — [Name], [Title] at [Company]

## Case Study One-Liners

**4.** A mid-market fintech firm cut compliance review cycles from 5 days to 8 hours using AfrexAI's vertical compliance agent — no system migration required.

**5.** One professional services company eliminated 34 hours per week of manual lead follow-up. Three agents. Deployed on a Tuesday. Live by Thursday.

## Landing Page Social Proof

**6.** "70% of digital transformation projects fail. Our agent deployments go live in days, not quarters."

**7.** "$1.3 trillion was spent on digital transformation that didn't work. We deploy AI agents on top of what you already have — and they start working on day one."

**8.** "54% of companies are already deploying autonomous agents (Salesforce, 2026). The question isn't whether to start. It's how far behind you want to be."
