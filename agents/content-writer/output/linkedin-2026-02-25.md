Your company has a $120K problem hiding in plain sight.

It's not a bad hire. It's not a failed campaign. It's the 30+ hours your team burns every week on tasks no human should be doing.

Data entry. Follow-up emails. Report formatting. Invoice chasing. Lead qualification.

Add it up: 30 hours × $75/hr average loaded cost × 52 weeks = $117,000/year. Gone. On work that an AI agent handles in seconds.

Here's what gets me: companies will spend 6 months evaluating automation platforms, run a pilot, form a committee, schedule a review — and burn another $60K in wasted labor while they "assess."

We deploy AI agents in days. Not weeks. Not quarters. Days.

One real estate brokerage cut their admin backlog by 40 hours in the first week. A fintech firm automated their entire compliance reporting pipeline — something that used to eat two full-time headcount.

The question isn't "should we automate?" That debate ended in 2024.

The question is: how many more $120K years are you willing to waste before you stop studying the problem and start solving it?

If you're curious what 3-4 AI agents could actually do for your team, the math takes 15 minutes: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min
