Legora just became YC's fastest unicorn at $6B.

They're building legal AI for BigLaw — the firms billing $1,500/hour that can afford anything.

But here's the gap nobody's talking about: mid-market law firms. 50-500 people. Too big to ignore AI. Too small for Legora's attention.

These firms spend 60%+ of associate time on document review, contract redlining, and compliance checks. Work that AI agents handle in hours, not days.

Legora's $6B valuation doesn't help them. It just proves the market is real.

The mid-market needs something different:
→ Deploys in days, not quarters
→ Understands legal compliance out of the box
→ Costs a fraction of enterprise contracts
→ Shows results in week one — not month six

That's the exact gap we built Verdict AI to fill.

If your firm is still doing manual document review while BigLaw automates, the gap isn't closing. It's accelerating.

What's the one legal workflow your team spends the most time on that no human should be doing manually?
