You didn't build your own CRM. You didn't build your own payroll system.

So why are you trying to build your own AI agents from scratch?

Every week I talk to founders who've spent 3 months duct-taping GPT wrappers together. They've got a Slack bot that sometimes works, an email responder that occasionally hallucinates, and a "data pipeline" that's really just a cron job and a prayer.

Meanwhile their competitor hired a managed AI workforce and had 4 agents live in a week.

Here's the thing nobody wants to admit: building AI agents is easy. Building AI agents that actually run your business without breaking things? That's a different sport entirely.

It's the difference between installing a security camera and hiring a security team. One watches. The other responds.

The companies winning with AI right now aren't the ones with the best engineers. They're the ones who stopped treating AI like a science project and started treating it like hiring.

You wouldn't build your own accounting software. Stop building your own AI workforce.

What's the one process in your business you've been "meaning to automate" for 6 months?
