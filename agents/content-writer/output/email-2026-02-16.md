# Cold Outreach Email

**Subject:** $1.3T on digital transformation. 70% failed.

[First name],

Quick math: McKinsey says 70% of digital transformation projects fail. The tab so far? $1.3 trillion.

The pattern is always the same — rip out systems, rebuild from scratch, hope it works in 18 months.

AI agents take a different approach. They layer on top of what you already use. No migration. No 6-month timeline. One workflow automated in days.

We deploy managed AI agents for [industry] companies. Most see measurable results in the first week.

Worth a 15-minute conversation to see where you're leaking hours?

# Nurture Email

**Subject:** The one question that reveals your biggest cost leak

Hi [First name],

Here's a question that catches most founders off guard:

*How many hours does your team spend each week on work that doesn't require human judgment?*

Data entry. Follow-ups. Report formatting. Compliance checks where the answer is "approved" 95% of the time.

When we ask this, the number is usually 30+ hours per week. Some companies are north of 60.

Those hours have a dollar amount. And it's almost always higher than people expect.

We built a calculator that runs the math in about 2 minutes. No email gate, no sales pitch — just a number.

If the result surprises you (it probably will), our AI Automation Playbook walks through exactly how to fix it. 6,500 words. Zero fluff.
