Generic AI tools churn at 60-70%. Vertical AI agents retain 3-5x better.

Why? Because a generic chatbot doesn't know what "material adverse change" means in your M&A clause. It doesn't know that a CBC result outside range needs escalation in 4 hours, not 4 days.

Vertical agents do.

They speak your industry's language. They know the workflows. They understand what "urgent" actually means in YOUR context — not some averaged-out, one-size-fits-nobody definition.

The data backs it up:
→ 87% of companies adopted AI last year
→ Most churned within 90 days
→ The ones that stuck? Industry-specific agents with domain context baked in

Legora just hit $6B building vertical AI for legal. Secai is doing it for healthcare. The pattern is clear.

Generic = commodity. Vertical = competitive moat.

At AfrexAI, every agent we deploy comes pre-loaded with industry context — compliance rules, terminology, workflows, edge cases. Not a blank canvas you have to train yourself.

That's the difference between a tool and a workforce.

What industry are you in? I'll tell you what your agents should already know.
