$1.3 trillion spent on digital transformation. 70% of it failed.

Not because the tech was wrong. Because the approach was.

Digital transformation asked companies to rebuild everything — rip out old systems, retrain entire teams, pray it works in 18 months.

Agentic AI doesn't ask you to rebuild anything.

It sits on top of what you already have. Your CRM stays. Your ERP stays. Your team stays.

The difference: instead of digitizing a broken process, you deploy an agent that handles the process autonomously.

Compliance reviews that took 3 days? Done in hours.
Invoice reconciliation across 4 systems? One agent, no manual touch.
Customer follow-ups falling through cracks? An agent catches every single one.

Salesforce found 87% of companies are already using AI. But 54% are deploying agents — not chatbots, not dashboards. Autonomous agents that do the work.

The companies still running "transformation projects" with 18-month timelines are going to wake up to a competitor who deployed 4 agents in a week and cut their operating costs by 30%.

This isn't digital transformation 2.0. It's the replacement.

What process in your business would you hand to an agent today?
