# Funnel Metrics & Conversion Optimization
## AfrexAI Marketing Analyst — The Path from Visitor to £25K Client

### The AfrexAI Revenue Funnel

Every pound of the £1M ARR target flows through this funnel. Understanding
conversion rates at each stage — and systematically improving them — is the
marketing analyst's primary ongoing mission.

### Conversion Optimization Priorities

Optimize from the BOTTOM up. A 5% improvement at Opportunity→Client is worth
more than a 20% improvement at Visitor→Lead.

#### 1. Opportunity → Client (Highest Leverage)

**Current state to diagnose:**
- Average proposal value
- Common objections at proposal stage
- Time from proposal to decision
- Competitive loss reasons

**Optimization tactics:**
- Improve proposal quality (include ROI projection specific to prospect)
- Add social proof tailored to prospect's industry
- Reduce proposal turnaround to <72 hours
- Implement "mutual action plan" (shared timeline to close)
- Follow-up cadence: Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14
- Offer pilot project option to reduce perceived risk

#### 2. SQL → Opportunity

**Optimization tactics:**
- Better discovery call framework (diagnose before prescribing)
- Pre-call research checklist (know their business before the call)
- Same-day follow-up with personalized recap
- Video walkthrough of relevant case study after call
- Clear next steps agreed before ending every call

#### 3. MQL → SQL

**Optimization tactics:**
- Speed to lead: respond within 5 minutes (6x more likely to connect)
- Multi-touch follow-up: email + LinkedIn + phone
- Lead scoring accuracy (reduce false positives wasting time)
- Nurture sequences for MQLs not yet ready (stay top of mind)

#### 4. Lead → MQL

**Optimization tactics:**
- Better lead magnets (more specific, higher perceived value)
- Email nurture sequences (5-7 emails over 3 weeks)
- Progressive profiling (gather more data over time)
- Behavioral triggers (pricing page visit → immediate outreach)

#### 5. Visitor → Lead

**Optimization tactics:**
- Landing page A/B testing (headline, CTA, form length)
- Exit-intent popups with lead magnet offer
- Chatbot for real-time engagement
- Content upgrades within blog posts (contextual CTAs)
- Reduce form fields (name + email only for initial capture)

### Funnel Dashboard Requirements

Real-time dashboard showing:
- Current month's numbers at each stage
- Conversion rates between stages (vs target)
- Trend: MoM comparison for each metric
- Velocity: average days at each stage
- Source: breakdown by channel (which channel produces best conversions?)

### A/B Testing Program

Always have tests running:
- **Month 1-2**: Landing page headline + CTA tests
- **Month 3-4**: Email nurture sequence variations
- **Month 5-6**: Discovery call script optimization
- **Month 7-8**: Proposal format and pricing presentation
- **Ongoing**: Subject lines, send times, content formats

Test one variable at a time. Need 100+ observations per variant for significance.

### Funnel Leak Analysis (Monthly)

Every month, identify the biggest leak:
1. Which stage has the largest drop-off vs target?
2. What's causing it? (data, not assumptions)
3. What's the specific fix?
4. When will it be implemented?
5. How will we measure improvement?

### Attribution Model

Use **multi-touch attribution** (not last-click):
- First touch: 30% credit (what brought them in)
- Lead creation: 30% credit (what converted them)
- Last touch: 40% credit (what closed them)

This ensures content/SEO gets credit for awareness while outbound gets
credit for closing, creating accurate channel ROI calculations.
