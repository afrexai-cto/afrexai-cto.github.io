# 📊 Competitor Updates

## 2026-02-13

### CrewAI
- **Major:** Published "2026 State of Agentic AI Survey Report" (Feb 12-13) — surveyed 500 C-level execs
  - 65% of enterprises already using AI agents
  - 81% have fully adopted or actively scaling agentic AI
  - **100% plan to expand agentic AI in 2026**
  - 74% view production deployment as critical priority
- Positioning themselves as "leading enterprise platform for multi-agent systems"
- Reddit sentiment: CrewAI seen as better for prototyping than hardened production deployments — **opportunity for AfrexAI to position on production-readiness**

### LangChain / LangGraph
- Published January 2026 newsletter: new agent-building updates, experiment comparison features, observability/evaluation focus
- Market perception: LangGraph increasingly seen as the "serious" option for stateful, self-correcting agents
- Still framework-level, not full platform — leaves room for higher-level solutions like AfrexAI

### Relevance AI
- Featured as SaaStr "AI App of the Week" (Feb 2026)
- $37M+ total funding ($24M Series B May 2025, Bessemer)
- Positioning: "Ops teams build entire AI workforces without code"
- **Direct competitor angle:** No-code AI workforce builder — similar to AfrexAI's agent swarm concept but more ops-focused

### AutoGen (Microsoft)
- No significant new announcements this week
- Reddit perception still "used in production by some Microsoft teams" but not broadly adopted externally
- Wikipedia updated: listed among standard agent frameworks alongside LangChain, CAMEL, OpenAI Swarm

### Beam AI
- Minimal news. Appears to be pivoting more toward construction/takeoff automation (BeamGPT) rather than general enterprise agents
- Less direct competitor than initially assessed

### New Entrant: OpenAI Frontier Platform
- OpenAI launched "Frontier" enterprise agent deployment/management platform
- Supports agents built with LangChain, CrewAI, or in-house
- **Threat level: HIGH** — could commoditize agent orchestration

### Key Takeaway
CrewAI's survey data is gold for content marketing — validates the market. But their "prototyping > production" perception is AfrexAI's wedge. OpenAI Frontier is the biggest new threat to track.
