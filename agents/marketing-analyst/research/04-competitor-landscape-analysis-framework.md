# Competitor Landscape Analysis Framework
## AfrexAI Marketing Analyst — Know the Battlefield

### Why Competitive Intelligence Matters

UK AI consulting/agency market is growing rapidly. New entrants appear monthly.
AfrexAI must know who's competing for the same £25K deals and how to position
against them. This isn't about copying — it's about finding gaps.

### Competitor Categories

#### Category 1: Direct Competitors (AI Agencies, UK-Based)
Small to mid-sized agencies offering similar AI implementation services.
These compete head-to-head for the same ICP.

**What to track:**
- Services offered and pricing (if discoverable)
- Client logos and case studies
- Team size and key hires
- Content strategy and LinkedIn presence
- Technology partnerships (Microsoft, AWS, Google)
- Funding status

#### Category 2: Adjacent Competitors (Digital/Tech Agencies Adding AI)
Traditional digital agencies (web dev, data, marketing) adding AI services.
They have existing client relationships and cross-sell AI.

**Threat level**: High — they have the clients, just adding the capability
**AfrexAI advantage**: Deep AI specialization vs their generalist approach

#### Category 3: Big Consultancies (Deloitte, Accenture, PwC AI Divisions)
Enterprise-focused, £100K+ engagements. Not directly competing but set
market expectations and sometimes serve mid-market via smaller offerings.

**Threat level**: Low for core ICP (too expensive for mid-market)
**AfrexAI advantage**: Price, speed, less bureaucratic

#### Category 4: In-House Build (Client Does It Themselves)
The biggest competitor isn't a company — it's the client deciding to hire
a data scientist and build internally.

**Threat level**: Medium — common reason for "no decision" losses
**AfrexAI counter**: Speed to value, breadth of expertise, lower risk

### Competitive Positioning Matrix

Map competitors on two axes relevant to AfrexAI's ICP:

**X-axis**: Specialization (Generalist → AI Specialist)
**Y-axis**: Price Point (Budget → Premium)

AfrexAI target position: **Mid-price, high-specialization**
- More specialized than digital agencies adding AI
- More affordable and agile than Big 4 consultancies
- More experienced than freelance AI consultants

### Win/Loss Analysis Integration

Every lost deal: ask "Who did you choose instead, and why?"

Track:
- Competitor name (or "built in-house" / "did nothing")
- Reason for loss: price, capability, relationship, timing, trust
- Pattern recognition: losing repeatedly to same competitor = strategic problem

1. Updated competitor profiles (top 5-7 direct competitors)
2. New entrants spotted in the last quarter
3. Competitive positioning changes (anyone repositioning?)
