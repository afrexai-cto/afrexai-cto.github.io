# ICP Definition for AI Agency Clients
## AfrexAI Marketing Analyst — Targeting for £1M ARR in UK Market

### What Makes a Good AfrexAI Client?

Not every company that "wants AI" is a good fit. At £25K ACV, AfrexAI needs
clients with real budgets, genuine problems, and operational maturity to
implement AI solutions. Chasing the wrong clients kills margins and morale.

### Primary ICP: UK Mid-Market Companies

**Company Profile:**
- Revenue: £5M-£100M annually
- Employees: 50-500
- Location: UK-headquartered (or UK operations with local decision-makers)
- Industry: Professional services, financial services, healthcare, e-commerce, logistics
- Technology maturity: Uses cloud, has some data infrastructure, not fully AI-enabled

**Why this segment:**
- Large enough to afford £25K+ projects
- Small enough that AfrexAI is a strategic partner (not a commodity vendor)
- Complex enough to need external AI expertise
- Growing enough to see ROI from automation
