### CRM Gap Analysis (from existing data)

Current CRM is heavily skewed:
| Vertical | Companies | % of CRM | ICP Target |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Real Estate | 100 | 27% | Secondary |
| Fintech | 21 | 6% | PRIMARY |
| Insurance | 20 | 5% | Emerging |
| Banking | 20 | 5% | PRIMARY |
| Wealth Mgmt | 20 | 5% | PRIMARY |
| Accounting | 24 | 7% | Secondary |
| Healthcare | 10 | 3% | PRIMARY |
| Legal | 2 | <1% | PRIMARY |

### Recommendation
When search comes back online, prioritize:
1. **Healthcare companies (50-500 emp, US)** — only 10 in CRM, massive market gap
2. **Legal firms** — only 2 in CRM despite 5 deals being legal-focused
3. **Fintech/banking** — decent base but need more mid-market targets
