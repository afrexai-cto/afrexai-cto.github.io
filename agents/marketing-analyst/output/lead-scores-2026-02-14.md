## Notes

- No engagement data available (no analytics = all engagement scores at 1)
- Intent scored based on public signals only (job cuts, funding rounds, AI initiatives)
- **No HOT leads (8+)** — impossible to reach 8+ without engagement/intent signals from our properties
- Once analytics is live, expect LendingTree and ZeroDrift to move to HOT if they visit

## 🔴 Blocker

Cannot properly score leads without:
1. Website analytics (who's visiting?)
2. Email tracking (who's opening/clicking?)
3. Stripe data (who's checking out?)

Lead scoring is theoretical until instrumentation is live.
