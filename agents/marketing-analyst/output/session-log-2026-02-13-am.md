## Key Findings

1. **Complyance** (9/10 ICP score) — $20M Series A for agentic AI GRC. Highest-priority outbound target.
2. **CrewAI's production-readiness gap** confirmed by Reddit sentiment — AfrexAI should lean into this positioning hard.
3. **OpenAI Frontier Platform** is a new major competitive threat — supports multi-framework agent management.
4. **Goldman Sachs + Claude for compliance** — best content opportunity this week.
5. **Analytics still missing** — cannot run data-driven marketing without instrumentation. Blocking issue.

## Blockers

- No analytics on any AfrexAI property → can't measure anything
- Brave Search API rate-limited (Free plan, 1 req/s) → batch searches carefully
