## Brief #1: "Microsoft Just Made AI Agents Mainstream. Here's What Mid-Market Companies Should Do Next."

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Target Keywords** | AI agents mainstream, Microsoft Copilot agents, mid-market AI automation, enterprise AI agents 2026 |
| **Content Type** | Blog post (1,000-1,200 words) |
| **Funnel Stage** | TOFU (awareness) |
| **Angle** | Microsoft's $81.3B quarter features autonomous Copilot agents. Google + Cognizant scaling agentic AI. The "what is an agent?" phase is over. For mid-market companies (50-500 employees), the question is now: which agent understands MY industry? Big Tech serves enterprises. AfrexAI serves the mid-market with vertical specialization. |
| **Key Points** | 1) Microsoft Copilot 2026: autonomous agents managing email, scheduling, reports — 15M+ users. 2) Cognizant + Google Cloud: operationalizing agents at scale. 3) Why Big Tech agents are generic — they optimize for breadth, not your compliance requirements. 4) Mid-market gap: too small for SI engagement, too regulated for generic tools. 5) Vertical agents (fintech compliance, legal automation, healthcare ops) retain 3-5x better than horizontal. 6) AfrexAI's position: industry-specific context + production-ready deployment. |
| **Competitor Content to Beat** | FinancialContent's Microsoft revenue analysis — numbers only, no strategic takeaway for buyers. We add the "so what" for mid-market CTOs. |

## Brief #2: "From Pilot to Production: The 2026 Enterprise Agent Playbook"

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Target Keywords** | agentic AI production, AI agent deployment guide, enterprise AI agents 2026, pilot to production AI |
| **Content Type** | Long-form guide (2,000-2,500 words) |
| **Funnel Stage** | MOFU (consideration) |
| **Angle** | CrewAI data: 100% of enterprises plan to expand agentic AI, 74% say production is critical. But most are stuck in pilot. Healthcare: 43% piloting, 3% in production. This guide bridges the gap — framework for moving from POC to production agent deployment in regulated industries. |
| **Key Points** | 1) The pilot trap: why 97% of healthcare AI projects never reach production. 2) CrewAI survey data: expansion intent vs. execution reality. 3) Three blockers: governance/compliance, integration complexity, ROI measurement. 4) The governance mandate: Cisco, Kyndryl, Overmind — governance-aware agents are table stakes. 5) Framework: Assess → Govern → Deploy → Measure (with AfrexAI tooling at each step). 6) Case pattern: compliance-first deployment wins in regulated verticals. |
| **Competitor Content to Beat** | CrewAI's own survey blog — they present the problem but their product IS the problem (prototyping > production). We present the solution. |
| **CTA** | "Book a consultation — get from pilot to production in 7 days → [consultation link]" |
| **Deadline** | Feb 21 (Friday) |
