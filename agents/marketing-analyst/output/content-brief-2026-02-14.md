## Brief 1: "Why Agentic AI Succeeds Where Digital Transformation Stalled"

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Type** | Blog post (1,500-2,000 words) |
| **Funnel Stage** | TOFU (Awareness) |
| **Target Keywords** | "agentic AI vs digital transformation", "AI automation enterprise 2026", "why digital transformation fails" |
| **Angle** | Digital transformation burned $1.3T with a 70% failure rate. Agentic AI is different — it automates workflows, not just digitizes them. Use Riff white paper + Salesforce data as anchors. |
| **Key Points** | 1) DT failure stats (McKinsey: 70% fail). 2) Why agentic AI is structurally different (autonomous, outcome-based, no rip-and-replace). 3) Salesforce: 87% using AI, 54% deploying agents. 4) Real examples: compliance automation (ZeroDrift), healthcare (Secai), finance (40% middle-office by EOY). 5) CTA: "Find out what you're leaking" → calculator. |
| **Competitor Content to Beat** | Riff white paper (erp.today) — theoretical, no actionable CTA. We add real numbers + conversion funnel. |
| **CTA** | Link to AI Revenue Leak Calculator |
