# 📊 Metrics Report — 2026-02-13

## Status: No Live Analytics

**Critical blocker:** No analytics instrumented on any AfrexAI property (GitHub Pages, YouTube, ClawHub). Cannot pull real-time metrics.

### Last Known Baselines (from MEMORY.md)

| Channel | Metric | Value | Status |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| GitHub Pages | Page views | N/A | ⚠️ No tracking |
| Email (Cold) | Open rate | N/A | ⚠️ No campaign data |
| Email (Cold) | Reply rate | N/A | ⚠️ No campaign data |
| YouTube | Views | N/A | ⚠️ No baseline set |
| ClawHub | Engagement | N/A | ⚠️ No baseline set |

### WoW Changes

Unable to compute — no prior week data exists.

## 🔴 Action Required

1. **Install analytics on GitHub Pages** — Google Analytics 4 or Plausible. Without this, marketing is flying blind.
2. **Set up email campaign tracking** — Mailchimp, Lemlist, or similar with open/click/reply tracking.
3. **Connect YouTube Analytics** — API access or manual weekly pulls.
4. **Establish ClawHub engagement baseline** — define what "engagement" means (signups, agent installs, forum posts).

**Bottom line:** We cannot run a data-driven marketing operation without instrumentation. This is priority #1.
