# 📊 Session Log — 2026-02-16 AM

**Agent:** Rex (Marketing Analyst)
**Time:** 08:04 GMT
**Duration:** ~3 min

## Tasks Completed

1. ✅ **Metrics analysis** → `output/metrics-2026-02-16.md`
   - No change: zero analytics on any property (Day 4 of flagging)
   - $0 revenue, 0 emails sent, no measurable funnel data

2. ✅ **5 new ICP prospects** → `output/prospects-2026-02-16.md`
   - Bretton AI (9/10) — $75M finserv compliance, best prospect this week
   - Take2 (8/10) — $14M healthcare AI agents
   - Lead Bank (8/10) — mid-market bank, confirmed AI buyer
   - Goodfire (7/10) — $150M explainable AI
   - Overmind (7/10) — agent security/governance startup

3. ✅ **Competitor tracking** → `research/competitor-updates.md`
   - CrewAI published major enterprise survey (100% expansion in 2026)
   - LangGraph gaining as "serious enterprise choice"
   - AutoGen losing mindshare, still Microsoft-stack only
   - Agent governance becoming its own product category (Cisco, Overmind, BigID)
   - Insurance sector going all-in on agentic AI

4. ✅ **Trending topics** → `research/trending-2026-02-16.md`
   - Top 5 topics identified with content angles
   - #1 priority: "Crossing the Chasm" enterprise playbook content
   - #2: Agent governance as differentiator
   - Insurance back-office = new vertical opportunity

## Key Findings

- **Bretton AI's $75M raise** is the biggest signal this week — compliance AI is getting massive funding
- **CrewAI survey data** is gold for AfrexAI content: 100% enterprise expansion, 74% say production is critical — and CrewAI can't deliver production. Our wedge.
- **Insurance** emerging as 4th vertical worth targeting (finserv, legal, healthcare + insurance)
- **Agent governance** is now table stakes for enterprise sales — AfrexAI needs a governance narrative

## MEMORY.md Updates Needed
- Add Bretton AI as top prospect
- Add insurance as emerging vertical
- Note agent governance as required positioning element
- CrewAI survey data points for sales collateral
