# 📊 Metrics Analysis — 2026-02-16 (Monday)

## Status: No Live Analytics Available

**Critical gap persists (Day 4).** Zero instrumentation on any AfrexAI property.

| Channel | Status | Data Available |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| GitHub Pages (storefront) | Live | ❌ No analytics |
| GitHub Pages (calculator) | Live | ❌ No analytics |
| ClawHub | 23+ skills | ❌ No engagement data |
| Cold Email | Draft-only | 0 sent |
| YouTube | Inactive | No content |
| Stripe | Live, 16 links | $0 revenue |

## WoW Comparison

N/A — no baseline. This is now the 4th consecutive day flagging this.

## 🚨 Blocking Issues (Unchanged)

1. **Install GA4 or Plausible** on all GitHub Pages properties — every day without analytics = lost attribution data
2. **Connect ESP** (Resend/Mailchimp) for email tracking
3. **Stripe webhook monitoring** for conversion funnel

**Assessment:** Marketing is operating blind. Cannot measure ROI on any activity. This should be the #1 infrastructure priority before any new content or outreach investment.
