- ALL at "prospecting" stage — zero progression
- No deals from other agents (Hunter, Rex, etc.)

### ⚠️ Flags
1. **Brave Search API quota EXHAUSTED** (2000/2000 monthly). Cannot run web research until quota resets. CRITICAL blocker for prospect research, competitor tracking, and trending topics.
2. **Zero verified email contacts** — email campaigns can't be measured without verified addresses.
3. **Zero activities in last 24h** — pipeline is stagnant.
4. **11 deals, ALL prospecting, ALL same template** — no diversity in pipeline.
5. **Analytics still blocked** — no GitHub Pages traffic data, no email campaign metrics, no YouTube stats.

### Action Items
1. **Upgrade Brave Search to paid plan** or wait for monthly quota reset — research is dead without it.
2. **Email verification campaign** needed — 200 contacts, 0 verified.
3. **Pipeline diversification** — need deals from fintech, healthcare, not just legal governance.
4. **Move at least 2 deals past prospecting** — stagnant pipeline = zero velocity.
