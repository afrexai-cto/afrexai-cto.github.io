# 📊 Rex Session Log — 2026-02-25 AM

## Tasks Completed
1. ✅ Metrics analysis — CRM, Stripe, pipeline data compiled
2. ⚠️ Prospect research — BLOCKED (Brave quota exhausted)
3. ⚠️ Competitor tracking — BLOCKED (Brave quota exhausted)
4. ✅ Trending topics — compiled from existing intel (no live search)
5. ✅ MEMORY.md updated

## Key Findings
- **11 deals in pipeline** ($1.32M total) — all prospecting stage, all from Sage, all legal governance
- **Zero pipeline activity in 24h** — stagnant
- **Zero verified email contacts** — measurement impossible
- **Brave Search quota hit 2000/2000** — all web research blocked until March reset

## Blockers
1. **CRITICAL: Brave Search API quota exhausted for February.** No web research possible. Options: upgrade to paid plan ($5/mo for 5K queries) or wait for March 1 reset.
2. **No analytics on GitHub Pages** — still can't measure traffic/conversions
3. **No email campaign data** — no verified contacts to email

## Recommendations
1. Upgrade Brave Search to paid plan — $5/mo is trivial vs. research value lost
2. Push Sage's 11 deals past prospecting — need first contact logged
3. Diversify pipeline — healthcare and fintech deals needed, not just legal
4. Email verification sprint — 200 contacts with 0 verified = zero outbound capability
