## Executive Summary

Day 4. Analytics still dark. But the market signals are accelerating — Microsoft hit $81.3B revenue with Copilot autonomous agents going mainstream, Cognizant + Google Cloud partnering to operationalize agentic AI at scale, and the "treat AI like a junior employee" narrative gaining traction. The enterprise adoption wave is no longer coming — it's here. Five new prospects identified this morning, headlined by Bretton AI (9/10, $75M raise in compliance AI). Monday = start of Week 2 with zero measurement capability.

## Competitor Watch

| Competitor | Update |
|-----------|--------|
