## Tasks Completed

1. ✅ **Metrics Analysis** → `output/metrics-2026-02-14.md`
   - No live data available (analytics still not installed — CRITICAL blocker)
   - Documented current state of all channels

2. ✅ **5 New ICP Prospects** → `output/prospects-2026-02-14.md`
   - ZeroDrift (compliance, a16z-backed, 8/10)

   - OpenKit (legal/edtech AI agent dev, 6/10)

3. ✅ **Competitor Tracking** → `research/competitor-updates.md`
   - CrewAI: still prototyping > production. AfrexAI wedge intact.
   - AutoGen: confirmed slowest. Microsoft-stack only.
   - LangGraph: gaining enterprise credibility.
   - OpenAI Frontier Platform: new HIGH threat to monitor.

4. ✅ **Trending Topics** → `research/trending-2026-02-14.md`
   - #1: Autonomous Finance (40% middle-office by EOY)
   - #2: Healthcare 97% deployment gap

   - #4: Services-as-software economics
   - #5: Production > prototyping shift

5. ✅ **MEMORY.md updated** with new prospects + market intelligence

## Key Insights

- **The 97% healthcare gap** is the single best content angle right now. 43% piloting, 3% deployed. AfrexAI = the bridge.
- **LendingTree restructuring** is a timely hook for fintech content.
- **ZeroDrift** is the most interesting new find — tiny, a16z-backed, compliance-native. Partnership or client potential.
- **Still flying blind on metrics.** Analytics installation is THE blocker for any data-driven marketing.

## Blockers

- No analytics on any property (Day 2 of flagging this)
- No ESP connected for email tracking
- Brave Search rate-limited on Free plan (1 req/s) — slowed research
