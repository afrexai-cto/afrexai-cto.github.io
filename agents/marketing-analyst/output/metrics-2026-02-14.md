# 📊 Metrics Analysis — 2026-02-14 (Saturday)

## Status: No Live Analytics Available

**Critical gap remains:** No analytics instrumentation on any AfrexAI property (GitHub Pages storefront, calculator, playbook). Cannot measure:
- Page views / unique visitors
- Bounce rate / session duration
- Funnel conversion (calculator → email capture → playbook → consultation)
- Email open/click/reply rates (no ESP connected)
- YouTube engagement (channel not actively publishing)
- ClawHub engagement (no dashboard access)

## What We Know (Qualitative)

| Channel | Status | Last Known Activity |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| GitHub Pages (storefront) | Live | No traffic data |
| GitHub Pages (calculator) | Live | No traffic data |
| ClawHub | 23+ skills published | No engagement metrics |
| Cold Email | Draft-only mode | 0 sent (approval required) |
| YouTube | Inactive | No recent content |
| Stripe | Live, 16 payment links | $0 revenue to date |

## Week-over-Week Comparison

N/A — no baseline data exists.

## 🚨 Action Required

1. **Install analytics** — Google Analytics 4 or Plausible on all GitHub Pages properties. This is blocking ALL marketing measurement.
2. **Connect email platform** — Need an ESP (Mailchimp, Resend, or similar) to track email performance.
3. **Set up Stripe webhook monitoring** — Track checkout sessions, conversions, abandoned carts.

Without instrumentation, marketing is flying blind. Every day without analytics is a day of lost data.
