## Brief #1: "Vertical AI Agents Have 3-5x Better Retention. Here's Why."

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Target Keywords** | vertical AI agents, AI agent retention, specialized AI automation, industry-specific AI |
| **Content Type** | Blog post (1,200-1,500 words) |
| **Funnel Stage** | TOFU (awareness) |
| **Angle** | Data-driven argument: horizontal/generic AI tools churn hard. Vertical agents that understand your industry stick. Use the 3-5x retention stat + real examples. |
| **Key Points** | 1) Generic AI fatigue is real — 87% adopt but retention is the problem. 2) Vertical agents speak the domain language (compliance, clinical, legal). 3) 3-5x retention data from Presta research. 4) Case examples: legal (Legora $6B), healthcare (Secai), fintech (autonomous finance). 5) AfrexAI's approach: industry context packs + vertical agent configs. |
| **Competitor Content to Beat** | Presta's "15 AI Agent Startup Ideas" — broad but shallow. We go deeper on the WHY with data. |

## Brief #2: "Legora Just Hit $6B. What Every Mid-Market Law Firm Should Learn."

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Target Keywords** | Legora AI, legal AI automation, law firm AI, AI for mid-market law firms |
| **Content Type** | Blog post (800-1,000 words) |
| **Funnel Stage** | MOFU (consideration) |
| **Angle** | Legora's $6B valuation proves legal AI demand is real — but they're targeting BigLaw. Mid-market firms (50-500 people) are underserved. That's the gap. |
| **Key Points** | 1) Legora: YC's fastest unicorn, $6B, targeting $40M ARR — legal AI is validated. 2) BigLaw gets the love, mid-market gets left behind. 3) Thomson Reuters report: AI transforming legal, tax, accounting. 4) Mid-market needs: faster implementation, lower cost, compliance-aware. 5) AfrexAI Verdict AI: "Week I Win" demo in 7 days, not 7 months. |
| **Competitor Content to Beat** | Bloomberg/PYMNTS coverage is news-only. We provide the strategic takeaway for the buyer. |
