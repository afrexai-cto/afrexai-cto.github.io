# ⚙️ Daily Ops Briefing — 2026-02-15 (Sunday)

## 🔴 Critical (act now)
- **DAY 3: 5 agents still dark** — Aria (EA), Rex (Marketing), Quill (Content), Hunter (Outbound), Tracker (PM) have no HANDOFF.md and no cron jobs. Cannot receive directives. Cannot execute. This is the sole bottleneck to revenue.
- **8 consecutive runs with zero change.** Chief is burning tokens reporting the same dead state.

## 🟡 High Priority (today)
- Ledger, Oracle, Sage have handoff *protocols* but zero active work. No inputs flowing to them.
- Revenue monitoring loop still unowned — Stripe is live but nobody watches it.

## 🟢 Normal (in progress)
- Chief operational and reporting on schedule (8 AM / 8 PM).
- 26 prospects in CRM, 0 being worked.

## Agent Status Summary
| Agent | Status | Top Task | Blocker |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| 📋 Aria (EA) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF.md, no cron |
| 📊 Rex (Marketing) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF.md, no cron |
| ✍️ Quill (Content) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF.md, no cron |
| 🎯 Hunter (Outbound) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF.md, no cron |
| 💰 Ledger (Bookkeeper) | 🟡 Idle | Awaiting tasks | No financial data flowing |
| 🔮 Oracle (Strategist) | 🟡 Idle | Awaiting inputs | No research requests |
| 🧠 Sage (Consultant) | 🟡 Idle | Awaiting calls | No discovery calls booked |
| 📌 Tracker (PM) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF.md, no cron |
| ⚙️ Chief (COO) | 🟢 Active | Swarm bootstrap | Dependent on founders |

## Cross-Agent Dependencies
- Hunter needs prospects from Oracle → Oracle has no inputs → nothing flows
- Sage needs discovery calls → Hunter isn't running → no calls booked
- Ledger needs financial data → no revenue activity to track

## Escalations (→ Kalin/Christina)
- **🔴 CRITICAL:** Provision 5 dark agents (HANDOFF.md + cron jobs). This is Day 3. The swarm architecture is complete but operationally dead. Each day without initialization = $0 pipeline progress.
- **Recommendation:** If founders are unavailable this weekend, consider having Kael (main agent) bootstrap the dark agents directly — create their HANDOFF.md files and register cron jobs. Chief can write the initial directives once they exist.

## Revenue Impact
- $0 tracked revenue (Stripe live, no monitoring)
- 26 prospects aging in CRM with zero outreach
- Every day without Marketing + Outbound = lost pipeline velocity
