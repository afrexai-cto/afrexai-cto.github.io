# ⚙️ Daily Ops Briefing — 2026-02-14

> Run #6. Day 2. Saturday morning. Zero state change from yesterday.

## 🔴 Critical (act now)
- **5 agents remain dark** — Aria (EA), Rex (Marketing), Quill (Content), Hunter (Outbound), Tracker (PM) have NO HANDOFF.md and NO cron jobs. They cannot receive directives or execute work. This is day 2 of a dead swarm.
- **Revenue monitoring loop broken** — Stripe is live, products exist, 26 prospects in CRM, but no agent owns the sales/marketing motion. $0 tracked revenue.

## 🟡 High Priority (today)
- Cron schedule still fires inconsistently — needs founder review
- 3 idle agents (Ledger, Oracle, Sage) have protocols but no work flowing to them
- DNS, Google Workspace admin, LinkedIn admin — all still blocked on founders

## 🟢 Normal (in progress)
- Chief (COO) is operational and running on schedule
- Revenue infrastructure intact (Stripe, payment links, storefront, calculator)
- CRM has 26 prospects (18 enriched)

## Agent Status Summary
| Agent | Status | Top Task | Blocker |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| 📋 Aria (EA) | ⬜ Dark | Needs HANDOFF + cron | Founder provisioning |
| 📊 Rex (Marketing) | ⬜ Dark | Needs HANDOFF + cron | Founder provisioning |
| ✍️ Quill (Content) | ⬜ Dark | Needs HANDOFF + cron | Founder provisioning |
| 🎯 Hunter (Outbound) | ⬜ Dark | Needs HANDOFF + cron | Founder provisioning |
| 💰 Ledger (Bookkeeper) | 🟡 Idle | No financial data flowing | No inputs from other agents |
| 🔮 Oracle (Strategist) | 🟡 Idle | No research requests | No inputs from other agents |
| 🧠 Sage (Consultant) | 🟡 Idle | No discovery calls booked | No pipeline feeding calls |
| 📌 Tracker (PM) | ⬜ Dark | Needs HANDOFF + cron | Founder provisioning |
| ⚙️ Chief (COO) | 🟢 Active | Swarm coordination | Dependent on agent init |

## Cross-Agent Dependencies
- Marketing → Content → Outbound pipeline is entirely unbuilt
- No agent feeds Ledger financial data or Oracle research requests
- Sage has no discovery calls because Hunter isn't generating pipeline

## Escalations (→ Kalin/Christina)
1. **🔴 CRITICAL:** Initialize 5 dark agents (HANDOFF.md + cron jobs). This is the single blocker to revenue. Day 2 of zero progress.
2. **🟡 HIGH:** DNS configuration, Google Workspace admin, LinkedIn admin — all unchanged.

## Revenue Impact
- **Target:** $11M ARR
- **Current tracked:** $0 (Stripe live but unmonitored by agents)
- **VADIS:** $111K received pre-delivery
- **Pipeline:** 26 prospects, 0 agent-driven conversions
- **Risk:** Every day the swarm is dark = lost compounding time on the $11M goal
