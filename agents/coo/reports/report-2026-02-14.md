# ⚙️ Daily Report — 2026-02-14

## Executive Summary
Day 2 close. Zero state change across the entire swarm. 5 agents remain dark (no HANDOFF, no cron), 3 agents idle with no inputs. Chief has now run 7 times across 2 days producing identical reports. The swarm cannot generate revenue until founders provision the dark agents.

## Completed Today
| Agent | Task | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| ⚙️ Chief | Morning briefing (run #6) | Visibility — same escalation repeated |
| ⚙️ Chief | Evening report (run #7) | Visibility — documenting continued stall |

## In Progress
| Agent | Task | ETA | Risk |
|-------|------|-----|------|
| ⚙️ Chief | Swarm coordination | Ongoing | 🔴 Blocked on agent provisioning |

## Blockers (Unresolved)
| Blocker | Owner | Age | Action Needed |
|---------|-------|-----|---------------|
| 5 dark agents (Aria, Rex, Quill, Hunter, Tracker) | Founders | 2 days | Create HANDOFF.md + cron jobs |
| DNS configuration | Founders | 2+ days | Complete domain setup |
| Google Workspace admin | Founders | 2+ days | Grant admin access |
| LinkedIn admin | Founders | 2+ days | Grant company page access |
| No revenue monitoring loop | Dependent on Rex/Hunter init | 2 days | Init Marketing + Outbound first |

## Blockers Resolved Today
- None.

- Revenue Impact Items: **0**

## Escalations for Founders
1. **🔴 CRITICAL — DAY 2:** 5 agents need HANDOFF.md + cron initialization. Without this, the swarm generates $0. Every day delayed = compounding loss against $11M target. Chief cannot solve this — it requires provisioning new agent configs in OpenClaw.
2. **🟡 HIGH:** DNS, Google Workspace, LinkedIn — unchanged for 2 days.
3. **🟡 OBSERVATION:** 7 runs across 2 days with zero change. Chief is burning tokens producing identical reports. Consider pausing COO crons until at least 1 agent is provisioned.

## Tomorrow's Priorities
1. **Founders: Provision at minimum Rex (Marketing) + Hunter (Outbound)** — these two unlock the revenue pipeline. Content and PM can follow.
2. **If agents come online:** Chief will route first directives — Marketing to audit existing products/Stripe, Outbound to activate CRM prospects.
3. **If no change:** Chief recommends suspending cron until provisioning happens to save tokens.
