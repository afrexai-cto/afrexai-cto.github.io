# ⚙️ Daily Ops Briefing — 2026-02-13 (Evening Run #5, 9:30 PM)

## 🔴 Critical (act now)

- **Swarm is dead. Day 2. Zero change.** 5 of 8 agents (Aria, Rex, Quill, Hunter, Tracker) have no HANDOFF.md and no cron jobs. They cannot receive directives and never wake up. Chief has now run **5 times** documenting the same state. This is the single blocker to all revenue activity.
- **Founder action required:** Someone (Kalin or Christina) must create HANDOFF.md files and configure cron schedules for the 5 dark agents. Chief cannot do this — it requires agent provisioning.

## 🟡 High Priority (today)

- **Cron schedule still broken** — Chief fires at ~9 PM instead of 8 AM. Needs config fix.
- **Revenue monitoring loop** — Stripe is live but no agent owns tracking. Ledger should, but has no financial data flowing.
- **3 founder blockers stale:** DNS config, Google Workspace admin, LinkedIn admin — no progress.

## 🟢 Normal (in progress)

- Ledger, Oracle, Sage have handoff *protocols* but zero active work. They're idle, waiting for inputs that can't arrive because upstream agents are dark.

## Agent Status Summary

| Agent | Status | Top Task | Blocker |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| 📋 Aria (EA) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF, no cron |
| 📊 Rex (Marketing) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF, no cron |
| ✍️ Quill (Content) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF, no cron |
| 🎯 Hunter (Outbound) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF, no cron |
| 💰 Ledger (Bookkeeper) | 🟡 Idle | Awaiting tasks | No data flowing |
| 🔮 Oracle (Strategist) | 🟡 Idle | Awaiting inputs | No requests |
| 🧠 Sage (Consultant) | 🟡 Idle | Awaiting calls | No calls booked |
| 📌 Tracker (PM) | ⬜ Dark | Needs init | No HANDOFF, no cron |
| ⚙️ Chief (COO) | 🟢 Active | Swarm bootstrap | Dependent on founders |

## Cross-Agent Dependencies

- Rex (Marketing) → Hunter (Outbound): Marketing generates leads, Outbound converts. Both dark.
- Oracle → Rex/Quill: Strategy informs marketing and content. Oracle idle, recipients dark.
- Sage → needs Discovery calls from Aria (EA). Both sides blocked.
- Ledger → needs invoice requests from Tracker (PM). Both sides blocked.

## Escalations (→ Kalin/Christina)

1. **🔴 CRITICAL: Initialize 5 dark agents** — Create HANDOFF.md + cron for Aria, Rex, Quill, Hunter, Tracker. This is day 2. Nothing else matters until this is done.
2. **🟡 Fix Chief's cron schedule** — Currently fires ~9 PM, should be 8 AM + 8:30 PM.
3. **🟡 DNS, Google Workspace, LinkedIn** — Stale blockers, need owner assignment.

## Revenue Impact

- **$11M ARR target: at risk.** Zero revenue infrastructure is operational. Marketing and Outbound are dark. No leads generated, no pipeline movement, no conversion tracking. Every day the swarm stays dead is a day of $0 progress toward target.
- **VADIS $111K** received but pre-delivery — no agent tracking delivery milestones.
