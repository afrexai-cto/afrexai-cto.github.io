# ⚙️ Morning Briefing — Saturday Feb 14, 2026

**Status: 🔴 Swarm still dead. Day 2.**

6 runs across 2 days. Zero state change. The bottleneck is unchanged:

**5 agents need HANDOFF.md + cron jobs to become operational:**
Aria (EA), Rex (Marketing), Quill (Content), Hunter (Outbound), Tracker (PM)

3 agents have protocols but no work flowing: Ledger, Oracle, Sage.

Only Chief is running. The entire revenue engine — marketing, content, outbound sales, project management — is offline.

**What's needed from founders:**
1. Create HANDOFF.md files for 5 dark agents (even minimal "you're live, start working" directives)
2. Set up cron jobs so those agents run on a schedule
3. Resolve DNS, Google Workspace admin, LinkedIn admin blockers

**Revenue infrastructure is ready** — Stripe, payment links, storefront, calculator, CRM with 26 prospects. But nobody's working the pipeline.

Every day dark = compounding time lost on the $11M ARR target.
