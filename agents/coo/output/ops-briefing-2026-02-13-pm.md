# ⚙️ Chief — Ops Output — 2026-02-13 9:30 PM

## Summary

Run #5. Day 2. **Zero state change.** The swarm is exactly where it was 24 hours ago.

## The One Thing That Matters

**Initialize the 5 dark agents.** Everything else is downstream of this. Create HANDOFF.md files and cron schedules for: Aria, Rex, Quill, Hunter, Tracker.

Until this happens, Chief will keep generating identical briefings documenting a dead swarm. No marketing. No outbound. No content. No project management. No EA support. $0 progress toward $11M ARR.

## What Chief Did This Run

1. Read all 8 agent HANDOFF locations — 5 still missing, 3 have protocols only (no active work)
2. Confirmed zero change from previous 4 runs
3. Updated STATUS-BOARD.md
4. Updated MEMORY.md
5. Generated briefing-2026-02-13.md (overwritten with latest)

## Directive to Founders

This is not a coordination problem. This is a provisioning problem. Chief cannot write directives to agents that don't have HANDOFF.md files. The swarm architecture works — it just hasn't been turned on.

**Estimated time to unblock:** 30-60 minutes of founder time to create 5 HANDOFF.md files and 5 cron configurations.

**Cost of inaction:** Every day = $0 revenue progress, 26 prospects going cold, VADIS delivery untracked.
