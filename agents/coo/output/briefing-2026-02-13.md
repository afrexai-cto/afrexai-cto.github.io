# ⚙️ Chief — Morning Ops Summary (2026-02-13)

> Delivered to: Kalin via main session

**⚠️ Cron timing issue:** This "8 AM briefing" fired at 9:11 PM. Schedule needs fixing.

**Swarm status: 37.5% operational.** 5 of 8 agents are dark (no HANDOFF, never initialized). 3 are idle with protocols but no work. Only Chief is active.

## Top 3 Actions Needed

1. **Initialize 5 dark agents** (Aria, Rex, Quill, Hunter, Tracker) — create their HANDOFF.md files and cron jobs. This is blocking everything.
2. **Assign Stripe monitoring to Ledger** — revenue is flowing through Stripe with zero tracking.
3. **Resolve 3 founder blockers** — DNS, Google Workspace admin, LinkedIn admin have been stale since build.

## Revenue Risk

- 26 CRM prospects with zero outreach (Hunter is dark)
- 16 Stripe payment links with no marketing driving traffic (Rex is dark)
- $111K VADIS not tracked in any agent system
- Every day without Marketing + Outbound = lost pipeline velocity
