# 📌 Sprint W07 Review (10–14 Feb 2026)

**Goal:** Stand up core agent swarm, unblock DNS, keep content engine running
**Completion:** 37.5% (3/8 tasks)
**On-time delivery:** 37.5%

## Completed
- ✅ GitHub Pages maintenance
- ✅ US entity setup guide
- ✅ SOC 2 readiness package

## Carried Forward
- 🔨 Build remaining agent configs (P0)
- 🚫 DNS blocker (P0, blocked 4+ days)
- 🚫 Google Workspace (P1, depends on DNS)
- 🚫 LinkedIn admin access (P1)

## Ongoing
- 🟢 Content engine — running on schedule

## Blockers
| Blocker | Days Blocked | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| DNS config | 4 | Unresolved — escalated to COO Feb 13 |
| Google Workspace | 4 | Waiting on DNS |
| LinkedIn admin | 4 | Waiting on access grant |

## KPIs
- Tasks completed: 3/8 (37.5%)
- Blockers resolved: 0/3
- Escalations raised: 1 (DNS to COO)
- Average blocker age: 4 days

## Lessons Learned
- DNS dependency cascaded — blocked 2 downstream tasks. In future, identify dependency chains earlier and escalate at day 1, not day 3.
- P2 tasks all completed; P0/P1 tasks stalled. Sprint was bottom-heavy on easy wins.
- Need clearer escalation path when COO escalation doesn't resolve within 24h.

## Recommendations for W08
1. DNS resolution as #1 — set hard deadline (Tue Feb 17) with fallback plan
2. Agent config build can proceed independently — unblock from DNS
3. Consider alternative email tooling if DNS remains stuck
