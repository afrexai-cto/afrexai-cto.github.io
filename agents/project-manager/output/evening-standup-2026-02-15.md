# 📌 Evening Close-Out — Sunday, 15 Feb 2026

## Sprint Status: W07 CLOSED | W08 Starts Monday

No input received today. No tasks moved.

## Current State

| Item | Status | Days Blocked |
|------|--------|-------------|
| DNS blocker | 🚫 CRITICAL | **6 days** |
| Agent configs | 🔨 Overdue | Carryover |
| Google Workspace | 🚫 Blocked by DNS | 6 days |
| LinkedIn admin | 🚫 Blocked | 6 days |
| Content engine | 🟢 Running | — |

## Risk Flags

- 🔴 **DNS — 6 DAYS BLOCKED.** Tomorrow is day 7. This is the #1 priority for W08 planning. If no resolution by Tuesday EOD, recommend fallback domain or alternative provider. This single blocker is cascading to 2 downstream tasks.
- 🟡 **Agent configs** — Only unblocked carryover item. No progress reported over weekend. Must complete Monday.
- 🟡 **Sprint velocity declining** — W07 closed at 37.5%. Two consecutive low-velocity sprints will compound. W08 must recover.

## W08 Planning (Tomorrow AM)

Recommended priorities:
1. **P0:** DNS resolution — hard deadline Tue Feb 17, fallback plan required
2. **P0:** Complete agent configs — no dependency, no excuse
3. **P1:** Google Workspace (unblocks once DNS resolves)
4. **P1:** LinkedIn admin access
5. **P1:** Content engine continues

## Actions Needed

- **COO escalation:** DNS at 7 days tomorrow. If Kalin hasn't actioned, need alternative path (new domain, different registrar, Cloudflare direct).
- **Invoice triggers:** None. No milestones completed.
