# 📌 Daily Standup — 2026-02-22 (Sunday)

## ✅ Done (since last standup Wed Feb 18)
- Sage agent created 11 deals in CRM — AI Governance Framework prospects ($120K each)
- Pipeline value added: **$1.32M** in prospecting stage (Legal, Accounting, Insurance)
- Content engine continuing to operate

## 🔨 In Progress
- Agent swarm: Sage confirmed active. Other agents' status unknown — no reports received.
- AaaS launch: Sean Ford email sent Feb 22 (per MEMORY.md). Awaiting response.

## 🚫 Blocked
- **DNS** — 14+ days. Blocking: cold email system, Google Workspace, downstream workflows. No progress, no fallback executed.
- **LinkedIn admin** — 14+ days. Needs human action. Zero movement.

## 🔴 Overdue
| Item | Owner | Days Overdue |
|------|-------|-------------|
| DNS resolution | Ops 🔧 | 14+ |
| DNS fallback plan | Ops 🔧 | 5 (due Feb 17) |
| Agent configs completion | Ops 🔧 | 3 (due Feb 19) |

## 📋 Sprint W08 Closed
- **Result: ~14% completion (1/7).** Down from W07's 37.5%.
- Two consecutive sprints below 40%. Velocity is in free fall.
- 4 tasks carry forward to W09.

## 📋 Today's Focus (Sunday)
1. Board updated and W08 closed
2. W09 planning ready for Monday
3. **Escalation to COO:** DNS at 14 days requires a binary decision — resolve by Tue Feb 24 or permanently drop and find alternative. Cannot carry a third sprint.

## 🚨 Escalation
**To COO (Ops 🔧):**
- DNS blocker has now consumed 2 full sprints. Recommend: either resolve by Tue Feb 24 or officially kill the task and adopt a no-DNS workaround (e.g., use GitHub Pages email forwarding, third-party SMTP, skip custom domain entirely).
- Sprint velocity declining. Need right-sized W09 with only achievable tasks.
- Agent communication gap — no input files received in 4 days. Need status pings from active agents.
