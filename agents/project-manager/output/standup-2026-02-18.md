# 📌 Daily Standup — 2026-02-18 (Wed)

## ✅ Done (since last standup)
- Nothing. Zero tasks completed since sprint opened Monday.

## 🔨 In Progress
- Agent swarm 9/9 (Ops 🔧) — 5/9 complete, no update in 3 days
- Content engine daily output (Content agent) — assumed on track

## 🚫 Blocked
- Google Workspace setup — blocked by DNS (10 days)
- LinkedIn admin access — needs human action (10 days no movement)

## 🔴 Overdue
- **DNS blocker** — Ops 🔧 — **10 days overdue.** Hard deadline was Tue Feb 17. Missed.
- **DNS fallback plan** — Ops 🔧 — **1 day overdue.** Was due Tue Feb 17. Not executed.
- Agent configs (4 remaining) — due tomorrow Thu Feb 19. No progress signals. At risk of overdue.

## 📋 Today's Focus
1. **Execute DNS fallback immediately** — the hard deadline passed yesterday. We need an alternative path NOW.
2. **Agent configs** — due tomorrow. Need status signal from Ops.
3. **LinkedIn admin** — 10 days stalled. Escalate or drop from sprint.

## ⚠️ Escalation to COO

Sprint W08 is at **0% completion on Day 3 of 5.** Both P0 items are overdue. No input files received since sprint opened. No status updates from any agent.

This is the third consecutive day with zero progress. DNS has been blocked for 10 days — the hard deadline AND the fallback deadline have both passed without action.

**Recommendation:** If DNS cannot be resolved today, remove it and all downstream tasks from the sprint. Refocus W08 on agent configs only. Accept the sprint as a partial loss and plan W09 around what's actually unblocked.

Sprint completion forecast: **14% max** (1/7 tasks) if only content engine counts.
