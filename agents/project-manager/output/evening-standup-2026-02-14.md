# 📌 Evening Close-Out — Sat 14 Feb 2026

## Sprint W07 — CLOSED

**Completion: 37.5%** (3/8 tasks done)

### What shipped
- GitHub Pages ✅
- US entity guide ✅
- SOC 2 readiness ✅

### What didn't
- Agent configs — still in progress
- DNS, Google Workspace, LinkedIn — all still blocked

### 4 tasks carry to W08
All P0/P1 items roll forward. DNS blocker hits **5 days on Monday** — critical.

## ⚠️ Risk Flags
- **DNS (P0):** 4 days blocked, cascading to 2 other tasks. If unresolved by Tue, recommend alternative approach.
- **Sprint velocity:** 37.5% is unsustainable. W08 needs >60% to stay on track for swarm launch.

## Actions for Monday
1. W08 sprint planning — DNS as #1
2. Separate agent config work from DNS dependency
3. Set Tue Feb 17 hard deadline for DNS with fallback plan
