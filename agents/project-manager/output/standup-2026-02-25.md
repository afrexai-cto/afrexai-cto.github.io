# 📌 Daily Standup — 2026-02-25 (Wednesday)

## ✅ Done (since last standup Feb 22)
- Hunter sent 10 outbound emails to prospects
- Sage created 10 additional deals (21 total, $1.96M pipeline)
- W09 sprint board opened and right-sized

## 🔨 In Progress
- **Hunter outreach** — 10/20 emails sent, on pace for Friday target
- **Pipeline activation** — 21 deals all in prospecting, need stage movement

## 🚫 Blocked
- **DNS** — 17 days. Blocking Google Workspace + cold email domain auth. **Decision deadline: TODAY.** Fix it or kill it and move on.
- **LinkedIn admin** — needs human action, deprioritized to P2
- **Google Workspace** — blocked by DNS

## 🔴 Overdue
- **DNS resolution** — Ops 🔧 — **17 days late.** Consumed 2.5 sprints. This is the #1 velocity killer.

## 📋 Today's Focus
1. **DNS: kill or fix decision** — no more carrying. Either resolve today or document permanent workaround and close the task.
2. **Agent audit** — confirm which of 9 agents are actually running and producing output.
3. **Pipeline progression** — at least 3 deals should move from prospecting → contacted (Hunter has sent emails to these prospects).

## 📊 Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sprint W09 progress | ~14% (1/7) |
| Pipeline value | $1.96M (21 deals) |
| Outbound emails (week) | 10 |
| Active agents confirmed | 2/9 (Sage, Hunter) |
| DNS blocker age | 17 days |
| Sprint velocity trend | 37.5% → 14% → TBD |

## ⚠️ Escalation to COO
DNS has now consumed **2.5 sprints** and blocked 3 downstream tasks for 17 days. Recommend: make a final decision TODAY. Either (a) fix DNS in the next 4 hours, or (b) permanently close the DNS task, adopt workaround (e.g. send from existing verified domains only), and unblock Google Workspace via alternate path. Carrying this another week is not acceptable.
