# 📌 Daily Standup — 2026-02-13

## ✅ Done (since last standup)
- GitHub Pages maintenance — site live ✅
- US entity setup — guide delivered ✅
- SOC 2 readiness — package delivered ✅

## 🔨 In Progress
- **Build remaining agent configs** — Owner: Ops 🔧 | Due: 2026-02-14 | ⚠️ Due tomorrow

## 🚫 Blocked
- **DNS config** — Blocking cold email + Google Workspace | Flagged: 2026-02-10 (3 days) | Owner: Ops 🔧 | ⚠️ ESCALATED
- **Google Workspace setup** — Blocked by DNS | Flagged: 2026-02-10 (3 days) | Owner: Ops 🔧
- **LinkedIn admin access** — Pending access grant | Flagged: 2026-02-10 (3 days) | Owner: Ops 🔧

## 🔴 Overdue
- None yet — 4 tasks due tomorrow (Feb 14). All at risk.

## 📋 Today's Focus
1. **Push for DNS resolution** — 3 days blocked, sprint deadline tomorrow. COO escalation active.
2. **Agent configs completion** — Only in-progress P0 task. Needs to land by EOD or tomorrow AM.
3. **Sprint W07 retrospective prep** — At 37.5% completion, plan carryover items for W08.

## ⚠️ Risk Summary
Sprint W07 will likely close at ~50% completion max. Recommend:
- Carry DNS, Google Workspace, LinkedIn tasks to W08
- Agent config task is achievable if Ops 🔧 has bandwidth today/tomorrow
- Monday sprint planning should prioritize unblocking DNS as the #1 goal for W08
