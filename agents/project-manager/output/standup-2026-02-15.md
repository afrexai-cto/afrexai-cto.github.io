# 📌 Daily Standup — 2026-02-15 (Sunday)

## ✅ Done (since last standup)
- Sprint W07 closed and archived (37.5% completion)

## 🔨 In Progress
- Agent configs build (Owner: Ops 🔧) — carried to W08
- Content engine daily output (Owner: Content agent) — ongoing

## 🚫 Blocked
- **DNS** — 6 days blocked. Cascading to Google Workspace + cold email. CRITICAL.
- **Google Workspace** — depends on DNS resolution
- **LinkedIn admin access** — pending, no movement

## 🔴 Overdue
- DNS blocker resolution — Owner: Ops 🔧 — 6 days (since ~Feb 9). **ESCALATION: Hard deadline Tue Feb 17 set. Fallback plan needed if unresolved.**
- Agent configs — Owner: Ops 🔧 — 1 day overdue (was due Feb 14). Independent of DNS, should be completable.
- Google Workspace — Owner: Ops 🔧 — 1 day overdue (DNS-dependent)
- LinkedIn admin — Owner: Ops 🔧 — 1 day overdue

## 📋 Today's Focus
1. **DNS fallback plan** — research alternative providers/workarounds before Tue deadline
2. **Agent configs** — unblocked work, should be pushed to completion
3. **W08 sprint prep** — draft task list for Monday planning session

## ⚠️ Escalation to COO
DNS blocker approaching 1 week. If no resolution by Tue Feb 17, recommend switching DNS provider or alternative domain strategy. This is the #1 risk to the entire pipeline — 3 tasks downstream are blocked.
