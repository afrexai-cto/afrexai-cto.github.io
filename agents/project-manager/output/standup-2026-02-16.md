## 🗓️ Monday Sprint Planning — W08

Sprint W08 (Feb 16–20) already planned from Friday close-out. Board is set with 7 tasks, 2x P0.

**Sprint priorities this week:**
1. **P0: DNS unblock by Tue Feb 17** — or execute fallback (alternative DNS provider, temporary domain, etc.)
2. **P0: Agent swarm to 9/9** — 4 configs remaining, no blockers
3. **P1: Unblock Google Workspace + LinkedIn** — cascading from DNS

**Roadmap check:**
- Agent swarm 9/9 due Feb 21 — on track IF configs ship this week
- GitHub Pages site due Feb 28 — 🔴 AT RISK (DNS dependency)
- Content engine v1 due Mar 1 — 🟡 AT RISK (LinkedIn admin needed)
- Cold email MVP due Mar 7 — 🔴 AT RISK (Google Workspace → DNS)

**⚠️ Escalation to COO:**
DNS is now at **7 days**. This is blocking 3 downstream milestones (site, email, workspace). If not resolved by EOD Tue Feb 17, recommend:
- Alternative DNS provider (Cloudflare, Route53)
- Temporary subdomain on working DNS
- Direct domain registrar nameserver config

LinkedIn admin access also needs human action — flagging again.
