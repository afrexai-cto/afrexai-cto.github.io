## Log

- **2026-02-13:** DNS blocker hit 3-day escalation threshold. Sprint W07 at 37.5% completion with 4 tasks due tomorrow — all at risk. Escalation raised to COO. Recommend carrying blocked items to W08.
- **2026-02-13 (PM):** Evening standup generated. No input files received. Sprint W07 unchanged — still 37.5%. All 3 blockers persist (DNS, Google Workspace, LinkedIn). Sprint will likely close at ~50% max. W08 planning needed Monday — DNS unblock must be #1 priority.
