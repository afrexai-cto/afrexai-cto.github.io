## Active Blockers

- **DNS** — Blocking cold email system deployment
- **Google Workspace** — Setup/config pending
- **LinkedIn admin** — Access needed for content/outreach workflows

## Sprint Cadence

- **Cycle:** Weekly sprints
- **Planning:** Monday AM
- **Review:** Friday PM
- **Standup:** Daily (8am via cron)

## Key Dates

- Swarm started: Feb 2026
- First sprint: w/c 10 Feb 2026

## Lessons
- DNS dependency cascaded — blocked 2 downstream tasks. Escalate at day 1, not day 3.
- P2 tasks completed easily; P0/P1 stalled. Watch for bottom-heavy sprints.
- Need fallback plans when primary escalation path stalls.

## Log

- **2026-02-13:** DNS blocker hit 3-day escalation threshold. Sprint W07 at 37.5% completion with 4 tasks due tomorrow — all at risk. Escalation raised to COO. Recommend carrying blocked items to W08.
- **2026-02-13 (PM):** Evening standup generated. No input files received. Sprint W07 unchanged — still 37.5%. All 3 blockers persist (DNS, Google Workspace, LinkedIn). Sprint will likely close at ~50% max. W08 planning needed Monday — DNS unblock must be #1 priority.
- **2026-02-14 (PM):** Sprint W07 CLOSED at 37.5% (3/8). Archived to sprints/sprint-2026-W07.md. 4 tasks carry to W08. DNS blocker at 4 days — set Tue Feb 17 hard deadline with fallback. W08 planning Monday.
- **2026-02-16 (AM):** W08 sprint opened. 7 tasks, 2x P0. DNS at 7 days, hard deadline Tue Feb 17.
- **2026-02-16 (PM):** Evening close-out. No input received all day. Sprint W08 still at 0%. DNS now 8 days — tomorrow is do-or-die. No progress signals on agent configs either. Zero-output Monday. Escalation repeated.
- **2026-02-18 (AM):** Wed standup. Sprint W08 Day 3, still 0% complete. DNS now 10 days — hard deadline (Tue) missed, fallback not executed either. Both P0 items overdue. No input files received Mon-Wed. Agent configs due tomorrow, no signals. This sprint is failing. Escalating again.
- **2026-02-22 (AM):** Sunday standup. Sprint W08 CLOSED at ~14% (1/7). DNS now 14+ days — consumed 2 full sprints. Sage agent active — created 11 deals ($1.32M pipeline) Feb 20-21. No other agent status updates. No input files since Feb 18. W09 carry-forward queued. Escalation: DNS must resolve or die by Tue Feb 24. Velocity declining — need right-sized sprints.
- **2026-02-25 (PM):** Wed standup (late — 12:24). W09 Day 2. CRM now shows 21 deals ($1.96M pipeline). Hunter confirmed active — 10 outbound emails since Feb 22. All deals still in prospecting stage — zero progression. DNS at 17 days — issued final kill-or-fix ultimatum for today. Sprint right-sized to 7 tasks. 2/9 agents confirmed active (Sage, Hunter). No input files received.
