## Active Blockers

- **DNS** — Blocking cold email system deployment
- **Google Workspace** — Setup/config pending
- **LinkedIn admin** — Access needed for content/outreach workflows

## Sprint Cadence

- **Cycle:** Weekly sprints
- **Planning:** Monday AM
- **Review:** Friday PM
- **Standup:** Daily (8am via cron)

## Key Dates

- Swarm started: Feb 2026
- First sprint: w/c 10 Feb 2026

## Lessons
- DNS dependency cascaded — blocked 2 downstream tasks. Escalate at day 1, not day 3.
- P2 tasks completed easily; P0/P1 stalled. Watch for bottom-heavy sprints.
- Need fallback plans when primary escalation path stalls.

## Log

- **2026-02-13:** DNS blocker hit 3-day escalation threshold. Sprint W07 at 37.5% completion with 4 tasks due tomorrow — all at risk. Escalation raised to COO. Recommend carrying blocked items to W08.
- **2026-02-13 (PM):** Evening standup generated. No input files received. Sprint W07 unchanged — still 37.5%. All 3 blockers persist (DNS, Google Workspace, LinkedIn). Sprint will likely close at ~50% max. W08 planning needed Monday — DNS unblock must be #1 priority.
- **2026-02-14 (PM):** Sprint W07 CLOSED at 37.5% (3/8). Archived to sprints/sprint-2026-W07.md. 4 tasks carry to W08. DNS blocker at 4 days — set Tue Feb 17 hard deadline with fallback. W08 planning Monday.
