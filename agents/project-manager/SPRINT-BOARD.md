## Known Carry-Forward

| # | Task | Owner | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---|------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Resolve DNS blocker | Ops 🔧 | P0 | 🔴 OVERDUE (14d) | Must resolve or permanently abandon this week |

## New Activity Since W08

- **Pipeline value added:** $1.32M in prospecting stage
- **No new activities logged** in activities table since Feb 18

## Risks
- 🔴 DNS blocker at 14+ days with zero progress — cascading impact on cold email, Google Workspace
- 🟡 Sprint velocity declining (37.5% → 14%) — need to right-size W09
- 🟡 No input files received since Feb 18 — communication gap between agents
