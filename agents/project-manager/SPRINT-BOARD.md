## Tasks

|---|------|-------|----------|--------|-----|-------|
| 1 | DNS blocker: resolve or kill | Ops 🔧 | P0 | 🔴 OVERDUE (17d) | Feb 25 | **Decision deadline TODAY.** Resolve or adopt permanent workaround. Stop carrying. |

| 3 | Pipeline deals → Contacted stage | Sage / Hunter | P1 | 🔨 In Progress | Feb 28 | 21 deals ($1.96M) all in prospecting. Need stage progression. |
| 4 | Agent swarm status audit | Ops 🔧 | P1 | TODO | Feb 26 | Which agents are active? Sage + Hunter confirmed. Others? |
| 5 | Google Workspace setup | Ops 🔧 | P1 | 🚫 Blocked by DNS | Feb 28 | If DNS killed, need alt email auth path |

| 7 | Content engine daily output | Content agent | P1 | 🟢 Running | Ongoing | Verify still producing |
