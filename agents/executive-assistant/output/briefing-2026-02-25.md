# 📋 Daily Briefing — 2026-02-25

## 🔴 Urgent

- **Brett McCroary (BuildGrid)** — 2 Stripe invoices overdue (34 and 65 days). Recommend escalation or service pause.

## 📧 Email Summary

### Kalin (ksmolichki@afrexai.com)
- **454 unread** total (bulk is GitHub deploy notifications — ~100+ cancelled workflow runs from Feb 22)
- **347 unread** after filtering automated/noreply
- **Notable:**
  - **Gemini meeting notes** — "Dev Weekly Touchpoint" Feb 4 & Feb 11 (unread)
  - **Google security alerts** — 2FA turned on, multiple security alerts (Feb 11) — likely from agent SMTP setup, no action needed
  - **Christina outreach** — "Jordan, the plate-spinning problem" sent Feb 22 (outbound, from ksmolichki@afrexai.com as Christina)
  - **DMARC report** from Google for afrexai.com domain (Feb 22)
  - **Retell AI** — product updates (marketing, low priority)
  - **Twilio** — A2P 10DLC campaign registration tips (relevant if voice agents planned)
- **No urgent inbound from clients or prospects detected in last 10 messages**

### Christina (cbeckford@afrexai.com)
- ⚠️ Inbox not checked — only one Gmail credential available. Christina's inbox needs separate IMAP credentials in 1Password.

## 📅 Calendar — Today & Tomorrow
- ⚠️ Google Calendar integration unavailable. No events to report.

## 💰 Stripe — Latest Activity
- **$12,143.00 USD** — Albert Thombs (VADIS) — Payment for Invoice — ✅ Captured successfully
- VADIS remains the anchor client. Recurring payment healthy.

## 📌 Action Items
- [ ] **Collections** — Follow up on Brett McCroary's 2 overdue invoices ($120/mo × 2) — Owner: Christina
- [ ] **Collections** — Decision on VADA $1,250 (259 days overdue) — write off or final notice — Owner: Christina
- [ ] **Inbox cleanup** — 454 unread is noise-heavy. Recommend auto-archiving GitHub workflow notifications via Gmail filter
- [ ] **Christina inbox** — Add cbeckford@ IMAP credentials to 1Password so both inboxes can be monitored
- [ ] **Calendar** — Google Calendar API integration still not set up

## 📝 Notes
- The inbox is dominated by GitHub Actions notifications (cancelled deploys). A Gmail filter rule to auto-label or archive `from:notifications@github.com` would cut noise by ~25%.
- Sean Ford outreach (Skilled Real Estate) was sent Feb 22 — no reply detected yet. Day 3 — still within follow-up window (5-10 day rule).
- DMARC report from Google arrived — worth reviewing to ensure afrexai.com email deliverability is healthy.
