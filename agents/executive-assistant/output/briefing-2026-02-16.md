# 📋 Daily Briefing — 2026-02-16 (Monday)

## 🔴 Urgent

- **⚠️ Gmail IMAP — Day 3 unresolved.** Cannot access either founder inbox. Authentication fails for `ksmolichki@afrexai.com`. App password in vault does not match or is for a different account. This has been flagged since Feb 13. **Recommend Kael verify the stored credentials and ensure an app password is generated for the AfrexAI business account.**
- **⚠️ Calendar integration — still missing.** No Google Calendar API access configured. Cannot check schedules for either founder.
- **⚠️ Slack — not configured.** No channel for briefing delivery.

## 📧 Email Summary

### Kalin (ksmolichki@afrexai.com)
⚠️ Gmail unavailable — IMAP authentication failure. Credentials in 1Password ("Google Account App Password") do not authenticate against `ksmolichki@afrexai.com`.

## 📅 Calendar — Today (Monday, Feb 16)
⚠️ Calendar unavailable — no integration configured.

## 📅 Calendar — Tomorrow (Tuesday, Feb 17)
⚠️ Calendar unavailable.

## 📌 Action Items

- [ ] **Fix Gmail IMAP credentials** — Kael — P1 — Generate app passwords for both `ksmolichki@afrexai.com` and `cbeckford@afrexai.com`, store in 1Password with clear item names
- [ ] **Set up Google Calendar API** — Kael — P2 — Service account or OAuth for both founder calendars
- [ ] **Configure Slack channel** — Kael — P3 — Assign a channel for Aria briefing delivery

## 📝 Notes

- Input queue (`input/`) is empty — no handoff packets to process.
- This is the 4th session with the same three blockers. Aria is fully operational but blocked on infrastructure access. Once credentials are provided, morning/evening briefings will include full email triage and calendar summaries.
- It's Monday — ideal day to unblock these so the week starts with full visibility.
