# 📋 Daily Briefing — 2026-02-15

> ⚠️ No morning briefing was generated today (Sunday). This is the evening-only entry.

## 🌙 Evening Summary

### Day in Review
- **Sunday, February 15th** — No morning run executed today.
- Gmail IMAP and Google Calendar integrations remain unavailable (same blockers since 2026-02-13).
- No handoff packets in `input/` queue.
- No morning urgent items to cross-reference.

### ⚠️ Unanswered Urgent Items
None flagged — no morning briefing was generated today.

### 🔧 Persistent Blockers (Carried Over)
These have been open since Feb 13 and remain unresolved:

| # | Blocker | Owner | Status |
|---|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | **Gmail IMAP access** — No mail script or IMAP skill available. Cannot scan either founder inbox. | Kael / Kalin | ❌ Blocked |
| 2 | **Google Calendar integration** — No calendar tool or API configured. Cannot pull agendas. | Kael / Kalin | ❌ Blocked |
| 3 | **Slack channel** — No dedicated EA channel configured for briefing delivery. | Kael | ❌ Blocked |

> **Recommendation:** Until these integrations are live, Aria's briefings will remain skeleton-only. Suggest Kael prioritize Gmail IMAP access (highest impact — unlocks email triage for both routines).

### 📅 Tomorrow's Agenda (Monday, Feb 16)
⚠️ Calendar unavailable — unable to pull events.

**Known carryover:**
- [ ] Resolve Gmail IMAP blocker — Kael
- [ ] Resolve Calendar integration blocker — Kael
- [ ] Configure Slack channel for EA briefings — Kael

### 📌 Open Items
- [ ] Gmail IMAP access — Kael — blocked since Feb 13
