# 🧠 Sage — Long-Term Memory

## Discovery Call Framework

1. **Pre-call research** (30 min minimum): Company size, revenue, tech stack, recent news, LinkedIn of attendees, competitors, regulatory environment
2. **Opening** (2 min): Acknowledge their world — reference something specific to them
3. **Pain discovery** (15 min): Open questions → follow-up → quantify impact. Never lead with our solution.
4. **Solution mapping** (10 min): Connect their specific pain to specific capabilities. Use their language.
5. **ROI preview** (5 min): Back-of-envelope calculation using their numbers
6. **Next steps** (3 min): Clear action items, timeline, decision-makers identified

## ROI Calculator Methodology

- **Time savings**: Map current manual processes → estimate hours/week → multiply by loaded hourly rate
- **Error reduction**: Current error rate × cost per error × volume = avoidable cost
- **Speed to delivery**: Current cycle time vs projected → revenue acceleration
- **Compliance risk**: Potential fine exposure × probability reduction = risk-adjusted savings
- **Always use conservative estimates** — underpromise, overdeliver

## Vertical-Specific Pain Points

### Legal
- **Primary pain:** Compliance burden — constantly shifting regulatory landscape
- Document review bottleneck, junior associate time drain

- Knowledge management across matters and precedents

### Construction
- **Primary pain:** Site reporting — fragmented data from field to office

### Healthcare

- Scheduling optimisation and no-show reduction
- Regulatory reporting (CQC, NHS Digital)

### Financial Services

## Objection Handling Playbook

## Active Knowledge

### Nonprofit Tech (Added 2026-02-14)
- **Primary pain:** AI adoption gap — 92% using AI but only 7% seeing mission impact (Virtuous 2026 Report, n=346)
- 81% ad hoc usage, no documented workflows; 47% have no AI governance policy
- Donor communication drafting, reporting, prospect research, data hygiene = ~£38K/year waste in 30-person charity
- Governance is the differentiator — charities handling donor PII need guardrails before automation
- Beacon CRM (ICP 9 prospect) serves this exact market — potential partnership angle
- UK addressable market: ~10,000 charities with >£1M income
- Key objection: "We can't afford AI" → reframe as "you can't afford the £23K/year you're wasting without it"
- Terminology: "donor stewardship", "gift aid", "trustee reporting", "cultivation meetings", "major gifts"

### Financial Services — AI Governance (Added 2026-02-16)
- **Primary pain:** AI accountability crisis — FCA moving from principles to enforcement in 2026
- SM&CR liability now explicitly extends to AI oversight — Senior Managers personally liable for algorithmic decisions
- FCA launched formal review into long-term AI impact (Jan 2026); audit trail + human-in-the-loop guidance expected this year
- Consumer Duty evidence compilation: 40 hrs/quarter manually, reducible to 10 hrs with automation
- FCA issued 140+ policy docs in 2025 — small compliance teams can't track all relevant changes
- 81% of businesses using AI have no documented workflows (BCC 2026) — for FCA firms this is an SM&CR timebomb
- ROI model: £42K/yr labour savings + £27K/yr risk reduction = ~£69K annual value vs £120K implementation (21-month breakeven)
- ICP: FCA-regulated SMEs 20-80 employees — IFAs, wealth managers, fintechs, boutique insurers
- Key objection: "We're too small for AI governance" → "The FCA doesn't fine by size. SM&CR applies to every regulated firm."
- Terminology: "Consumer Duty", "SM&CR", "SYSC 15A", "MRM principles", "file reviews", "suitability reports", "DIM permissions"
- Content handoff created for blog post + LinkedIn + lead magnet checklist
- **UPDATE 2026-02-18:** Treasury Committee published inquiry — called for **prescriptive AI regulation for financial advice firms by end of 2026**. This is a hard deadline, not guidance.
- Kennedys Law confirms "dual compliance framework" needed: FCA conduct + data protection simultaneously
- FCA COCON extension Sept 2026 — widens senior manager accountability net
- Guardian reports UK wealth manager shares falling on AI disruption fears (11 Feb 2026) — fear = buying urgency
- EY 2026 Outlook: "firms must prioritize regulatory adherence for AI in each jurisdiction" — Big 4 validation of our positioning
- **75%+ of UK FS firms already using AI** (BoE/FCA 2024 survey) — most without governance frameworks
- **US research gap CLOSED (2026-02-19):** FINRA 2026 report has dedicated GenAI section — first ever. Reg S-P compliance deadline June 3, 2026 for smaller firms. FinCEN reclassified investment advisers as "financial institutions" under BSA effective Jan 1, 2026.
- FINRA expects same supervisory rigor for AI outputs as traditional systems — recordkeeping deficiencies cited 50+ times
- Smarsh analysis: AI moving from experimentation to "operational dependency" — ungoverned usage = regulatory exposure
- Combined US/UK pitch: "2026 is the year AI governance goes from optional to mandatory — FINRA, FCA, and SEC are all converging"
- Top CRM prospects (updated): Mariner Wealth (450 emp, CEO Marty Bicknell), Cerity Partners (400 emp, CEO Kurt Miscinski), EP Wealth (400 emp, CEO Patrick Goshtigian), Moneta Group (350 emp), Pathstone (350 emp)
- Previously identified: Allworth Financial, Carson Group (wealth mgmt); Alerus Financial, Triumph Financial (banks); Riskalyze (partnership angle)

### Real Estate — Brokerage AI Governance (Added 2026-02-18)
- **Primary pain:** Ungoverned AI adoption — 97% of agents using AI but brokerages have no visibility, no audit trails, no compliance controls
- Delta Media 2026 Survey (100+ leaders, 2/3 of US transactions): 97% agent AI use, 49% governance concern high/very high, importance 7/10 rising to 8/10
- 81% of agent AI usage = listing descriptions + content creation — exactly where Fair Housing violations surface
- HUD updated disparate impact standards Jan 2026; Spencer Fane (Feb 2026) confirms regulators treat AI as extension of brokerage function — broker is liable
- Fair Housing first offense fine: $21,039+ (2024 adjustment)
- WAV Group (Jan 2026): governance is the competitive moat for brokerages
- Feb 11, 2026: "AI Scare Trade" — major RE service stocks plunged on automation fears

- CRM has 100 RE companies — largest vertical. Top ICP-4: Teifke RE, Phyllis Browning, JBGoodwin, Premier Sotheby's Tampa, Mainframe RE
- Solution: AI Policy Framework + Listing Compliance Agent + Transaction Coordinator Agent + Broker Dashboard
- Content handoff created for blog + lead magnet (10-Point AI Governance Checklist)
- Key objection: "Agents are independent contractors" → "You can't control their tools, but you ARE liable for their outputs."
- Terminology: "designated broker", "transaction coordinator", "Fair Housing Act", "disparate impact", "NAR Code of Ethics", "E&O insurance"
