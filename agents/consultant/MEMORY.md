# 🧠 Sage — Long-Term Memory

## Discovery Call Framework

1. **Pre-call research** (30 min minimum): Company size, revenue, tech stack, recent news, LinkedIn of attendees, competitors, regulatory environment
2. **Opening** (2 min): Acknowledge their world — reference something specific to them
3. **Pain discovery** (15 min): Open questions → follow-up → quantify impact. Never lead with our solution.
4. **Solution mapping** (10 min): Connect their specific pain to specific capabilities. Use their language.
5. **ROI preview** (5 min): Back-of-envelope calculation using their numbers
6. **Next steps** (3 min): Clear action items, timeline, decision-makers identified

## ROI Calculator Methodology

- **Time savings**: Map current manual processes → estimate hours/week → multiply by loaded hourly rate
- **Error reduction**: Current error rate × cost per error × volume = avoidable cost
- **Speed to delivery**: Current cycle time vs projected → revenue acceleration
- **Compliance risk**: Potential fine exposure × probability reduction = risk-adjusted savings
- **Always use conservative estimates** — underpromise, overdeliver

## Vertical-Specific Pain Points

## Active Knowledge

### Nonprofit Tech (Added 2026-02-14)
- **Primary pain:** AI adoption gap — 92% using AI but only 7% seeing mission impact (Virtuous 2026 Report, n=346)
- 81% ad hoc usage, no documented workflows; 47% have no AI governance policy
- Donor communication drafting, reporting, prospect research, data hygiene = ~£38K/year waste in 30-person charity
- Governance is the differentiator — charities handling donor PII need guardrails before automation
- Beacon CRM (ICP 9 prospect) serves this exact market — potential partnership angle
- UK addressable market: ~10,000 charities with >£1M income
- Key objection: "We can't afford AI" → reframe as "you can't afford the £23K/year you're wasting without it"
- Terminology: "donor stewardship", "gift aid", "trustee reporting", "cultivation meetings", "major gifts"

### Financial Services — AI Governance (Added 2026-02-16)
- **Primary pain:** AI accountability crisis — FCA moving from principles to enforcement in 2026

- Consumer Duty evidence compilation: 40 hrs/quarter manually, reducible to 10 hrs with automation
- FCA issued 140+ policy docs in 2025 — small compliance teams can't track all relevant changes
- 81% of businesses using AI have no documented workflows (BCC 2026) — for FCA firms this is an SM&CR timebomb
- ROI model: £42K/yr labour savings + £27K/yr risk reduction = ~£69K annual value vs £120K implementation (21-month breakeven)
- ICP: FCA-regulated SMEs 20-80 employees — IFAs, wealth managers, fintechs, boutique insurers
- Key objection: "We're too small for AI governance" → "The FCA doesn't fine by size. SM&CR applies to every regulated firm."

- Content handoff created for blog post + LinkedIn + lead magnet checklist

- Combined US/UK pitch: "2026 is the year AI governance goes from optional to mandatory — FINRA, FCA, and SEC are all converging"
- Top CRM prospects (updated): Mariner Wealth (450 emp, CEO Marty Bicknell), Cerity Partners (400 emp, CEO Kurt Miscinski), EP Wealth (400 emp, CEO Patrick Goshtigian), Moneta Group (350 emp), Pathstone (350 emp)

- NAIC Model Bulletin (Dec 2023) requires written AI governance programs — **23 states + DC adopted** by late 2025

- 1/3 of health insurers don't test AI for bias despite NAIC requirements
- Active lawsuits: Kelly v. State Farm (discriminatory AI claims), Kisting-Leung v. Cigna (AI claim denials without review)

- Content handoff created for blog + lead magnet (7-Point AI Governance Checklist)

### Regional/Community Banking — AI Governance (Added 2026-02-20)
- **Primary pain:** Ungoverned AI on two fronts — vendor-embedded AI they can't validate + staff using GenAI without policy
- CCG Catalyst (Feb 2026): CSPs embed AI into fraud/underwriting without disclosing model logic, training data, or governance — "real compliance exposure under fair lending laws"

- OCC Bulletin 2025-24: eliminated fixed exam requirements for community banks effective Jan 1, 2026 — replaced with risk-based supervision (ungoverned AI = easy examiner finding)
- OCC will NOT subject community banks to prescriptive model validation exams — but banks still must demonstrate governance "commensurate with risk"
