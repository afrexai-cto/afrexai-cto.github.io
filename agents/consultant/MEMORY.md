# 🧠 Sage — Long-Term Memory

## Discovery Call Framework

1. **Pre-call research** (30 min minimum): Company size, revenue, tech stack, recent news, LinkedIn of attendees, competitors, regulatory environment
2. **Opening** (2 min): Acknowledge their world — reference something specific to them
3. **Pain discovery** (15 min): Open questions → follow-up → quantify impact. Never lead with our solution.
4. **Solution mapping** (10 min): Connect their specific pain to specific capabilities. Use their language.
5. **ROI preview** (5 min): Back-of-envelope calculation using their numbers
6. **Next steps** (3 min): Clear action items, timeline, decision-makers identified

## ROI Calculator Methodology

- **Time savings**: Map current manual processes → estimate hours/week → multiply by loaded hourly rate
- **Error reduction**: Current error rate × cost per error × volume = avoidable cost
- **Speed to delivery**: Current cycle time vs projected → revenue acceleration
- **Compliance risk**: Potential fine exposure × probability reduction = risk-adjusted savings
- **Always use conservative estimates** — underpromise, overdeliver

## Vertical-Specific Pain Points

### Legal
- **Primary pain:** Compliance burden — constantly shifting regulatory landscape
- Document review bottleneck, junior associate time drain
- Contract lifecycle management inefficiency
- Knowledge management across matters and precedents

### Construction
- **Primary pain:** Site reporting — fragmented data from field to office
- Safety compliance documentation overhead
- Project timeline tracking across subcontractors
- Change order management and cost tracking lag

### Healthcare
- **Primary pain:** Admin overhead — clinicians drowning in paperwork
- Patient communication and follow-up gaps
- Scheduling optimisation and no-show reduction
- Regulatory reporting (CQC, NHS Digital)

### Financial Services
- **Primary pain:** Regulatory complexity — FCA, PRA, GDPR overlap
- Client onboarding and KYC/AML friction
- Report generation and audit trail maintenance
- Risk assessment documentation

## Objection Handling Playbook

| Objection | Response Framework |
|---|---|
| "Too expensive" | Reframe as cost of inaction. Show ROI timeline. |
| "We tried AI before" | Ask what specifically failed. Differentiate our approach. |
| "Our team won't adopt it" | Address change management. Show low-friction entry points. |
| "Data security concerns" | Detail our architecture. UK data residency. Certifications. |
| "Not the right time" | Quantify cost of delay per month. Find low-commitment starting point. |
| "Need to talk to [decision maker]" | Offer tailored exec summary. Ask to join next call. |

## Active Knowledge

### Nonprofit Tech (Added 2026-02-14)
- **Primary pain:** AI adoption gap — 92% using AI but only 7% seeing mission impact (Virtuous 2026 Report, n=346)
- 81% ad hoc usage, no documented workflows; 47% have no AI governance policy
- Donor communication drafting, reporting, prospect research, data hygiene = ~£38K/year waste in 30-person charity
- Governance is the differentiator — charities handling donor PII need guardrails before automation
- Beacon CRM (ICP 9 prospect) serves this exact market — potential partnership angle
- UK addressable market: ~10,000 charities with >£1M income
- Key objection: "We can't afford AI" → reframe as "you can't afford the £23K/year you're wasting without it"
- Terminology: "donor stewardship", "gift aid", "trustee reporting", "cultivation meetings", "major gifts"
