## AfrexAI — Winning Proposals for £15K-£50K Engagements | 2026

### Proposal Philosophy

The proposal is not a brochure — it's a decision document. Every section should move the prospect closer to "yes." UK B2B buyers want clarity, credibility, and confidence that you understand their problem.

**Target**: Send within 24 hours of discovery call. Speed signals competence.
