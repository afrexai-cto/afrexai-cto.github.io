# Objection Handling Playbook

## AfrexAI — Overcoming Resistance to AI Investment | 2026

### The Psychology of Objections

Objections aren't rejections — they're requests for more information or reassurance. In the UK B2B market, buyers are typically risk-averse and consensus-driven. Most objections fall into five categories: price, timing, trust, complexity, and internal politics.

**Golden rule**: Acknowledge, explore, reframe, confirm.

### Price Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
- Acknowledge: "I understand — £25K is a significant investment."
- Explore: "When you say too expensive, is that relative to budget or relative to expected return?"
- Reframe: "You mentioned this problem costs ~£80K/year. We're proposing to solve it for £25K with a 7-month payback. Is it the upfront cash flow that's the concern?"
- Offer: "We could start with a £5K Discovery Sprint — prove the value before committing to the full project."

**"We can build it in-house"**
- "You absolutely could. The question is: should you? What's your team's current capacity? Our experience is that internal builds take 3-4x longer and cost 2x more when you factor in opportunity cost. We'll have this live in 10 weeks."

**"Your competitor quoted less"**
- "I'd expect that — there are cheaper options. The question is what you're comparing. We deliver production-ready solutions with UK GDPR compliance baked in, not a proof of concept that needs another 6 months of work. What exactly did they propose?"

### Timing Objections

**"Not the right time"**
- "I hear that a lot. Can I ask — what would need to change for it to be the right time?"
- "The companies that wait for the 'right time' are the ones that end up 18 months behind their competitors. What's the cost of waiting another quarter?"

**"We need to finish [other project] first"**
- "Makes sense. When does that wrap up? Let's book a follow-up for then. In the meantime, I'll send you our AI Readiness Guide so your team can start thinking about this."

**"Our financial year starts in [month]"**
- "Perfect. Let's use the time between now and then to do a Discovery Sprint — that way you'll have a concrete business case ready for budget approval."

### Trust Objections

**"We've never heard of AfrexAI"**
- "Fair point — we're relatively new but deliberately focused. Rather than trying to be everything to everyone, we specialise in AI implementation for UK mid-market businesses. Here's a recent result: [case study]. I'm also happy to connect you with a current client for a reference."

**"AI is overhyped / doesn't work"**
- "I agree — a lot of AI is overhyped. That's exactly why we focus on proven, practical applications, not moonshots. The use cases we implement — document processing, workflow automation, intelligent search — are well-established. The risk isn't whether the technology works. It's whether it's implemented well. That's what we do."

**"How do we know you'll deliver?"**
- "Three things: First, we structure payments around milestones — you don't pay the final 25% until you're satisfied. Second, our Discovery Sprint is designed to prove we can deliver before you commit to a larger engagement. Third, I'll give you a client reference you can call directly."

### Complexity Objections

**"Our data is a mess"**
- "That's actually normal — most companies are in the same position. Part of our Discovery Sprint is assessing your data and identifying what's usable now vs what needs cleaning. You don't need perfect data to start. You need the right data for the right use case."

**"Our team won't adopt it"**
- "Change management is real. We include training and onboarding in every engagement. We also design solutions that fit into existing workflows rather than replacing them entirely. Adoption rates above 80% within 60 days is our benchmark."

**"We're worried about GDPR/compliance"**
- "You should be — and that's an area where working with a UK-based firm matters. We build compliance into the architecture from day one. UK data residency, ICO guidance, Data Protection Impact Assessments — all standard in our delivery."

### Internal Politics Objections

**"I need to get buy-in from [person/committee]"**
- "Of course. What would help them say yes? I can provide a one-page executive summary, ROI projection, or join a call to answer questions directly. What format works best for your internal process?"

**"The CTO is skeptical about AI"**
- "I'd love to speak with them directly. Technical leaders often have very valid concerns about integration, maintenance, and vendor lock-in. We can address those head-on. Would a 20-minute technical call be helpful?"

**"We have a preferred supplier list"**
- "I understand. What's the process for getting on that list? In the meantime, could we run a small Discovery Sprint as a trial? Many of our clients started that way before adding us to their preferred list."

### The "No" That Means "Not Yet"

Not every objection should be overcome. Sometimes the honest answer is:
- "It sounds like this isn't the right time. I'll follow up in Q[X]. No hard feelings."
- "Based on what you've described, we might not be the best fit. Let me suggest [alternative]."

**Walking away well creates future business.** 30% of AfrexAI pipeline should come from previous "not yet" conversations.

### Objection Response Training

Practice these monthly:
1. Role-play common objections with a timer (60 seconds to respond)
2. Record and review discovery calls for missed objection signals
3. Update this playbook with new objections as they arise
4. A/B test different responses and track conversion impact

### Key Metrics

- Objections per deal: track which come up most
- Conversion rate after objection handling: target 35%
- Most common objection by quarter: adjust messaging accordingly
- "No" to "Yes" conversion timeline: average time from objection to close
