# Use Case: AI Governance & Compliance Automation for UK Financial Services SMEs

## Vertical & Scenario

**Target persona:** Head of Compliance or COO at a UK FCA-regulated SME (20-80 employees). Could be an independent financial adviser (IFA) network, boutique wealth manager, or early-stage fintech with their first FCA permissions.

**Their day-to-day:** Drowning in regulatory change. The FCA launched a formal review into long-term AI impact in early 2026, and new guidance on audit trails and human-in-the-loop protocols is expected this year. Meanwhile, Consumer Duty obligations (July 2023 onwards) require continuous evidence that customer outcomes are being monitored. SM&CR means personal liability for Senior Managers if AI systems cause harm — and most firms are now using *some* AI (even if it's just ChatGPT for drafting).

They're stuck in a trap: they need AI to stay competitive, but deploying it without governance exposes them to personal sanctions, fines, and reputational damage.

## The Pain

### Quantified Problems

1. **Compliance officer time sink**: A typical FCA-regulated SME with 40 staff spends **15-25 hours/week** on manual compliance tasks — monitoring regulatory updates, updating policies, preparing board reports, conducting file reviews, responding to FCA information requests.
   - At £55/hr loaded cost = **£43K-£72K/year** in compliance labour alone

2. **Regulatory change tracking**: The FCA issued **140+ policy statements, consultations, and guidance notes** in 2025. A small compliance team cannot realistically track, interpret, and implement all relevant changes.
   - Missed regulatory changes = enforcement risk. Average FCA fine for SMEs: **£50K-£500K**

3. **Consumer Duty evidence gap**: Firms must evidence they're delivering good outcomes across price/value, products/services, consumer understanding, and consumer support. Most SMEs compile this manually from fragmented data.
   - Typical quarterly Consumer Duty board report: **20-40 hours** to compile manually

4. **AI governance vacuum**: 81% of businesses using AI have no documented workflows (BCC 2026). For FCA-regulated firms, undocumented AI use is a ticking bomb under SM&CR — Senior Managers are personally liable for AI decisions they didn't even know were being made.

5. **The 2026 accountability shift**: FCA is moving from principles to enforcement. Firms need explainable AI, audit trails, and human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions (credit, insurance, advice). Most SMEs have zero infrastructure for this.

## The Solution

AfrexAI deploys a **Compliance Intelligence System** — an AI-powered operational layer that automates the grunt work while building the governance framework the FCA now demands.

### Specific Capabilities

1. **Regulatory Radar**: Automated monitoring of FCA, PRA, ICO, and Treasury publications. Daily digest of relevant changes with impact assessment and required actions, tailored to the firm's specific permissions and business model.

2. **Consumer Duty Evidence Engine**: Automated collection and synthesis of outcome data across the four Consumer Duty pillars. Generates quarterly board reports with evidence trails — reducing 40 hours to 4.

3. **AI Governance Framework**: Documents every AI tool in use across the firm, maps data flows, establishes human-in-the-loop checkpoints, creates audit trails. Turns the SM&CR AI liability from risk into documented compliance.

4. **Policy Auto-Update**: When regulatory changes require policy updates, drafts amendments for compliance officer review. Maintains version history and board approval records.

5. **File Review Automation**: AI-assisted review of client files for suitability, disclosure completeness, and Consumer Duty alignment. Flags issues for human review rather than replacing judgement.

## ROI Numbers

### Assumptions
- Firm size: 40 employees, 1.5 FTE compliance team
- Compliance officer loaded cost: £55/hr
- Current manual compliance hours: 20/week average
- AfrexAI implementation: £120K first year (consulting + deployment)

### Conservative Savings

| Category | Current Cost | With AfrexAI | Annual Saving |
|---|---|---|---|
| Regulatory monitoring & interpretation | £28,600/yr (10 hrs/wk) | £8,580 (3 hrs/wk) | **£20,020** |
| Consumer Duty reporting | £8,800/yr (4 quarterly reports × 40 hrs) | £2,200 (4 × 10 hrs) | **£6,600** |
| Policy maintenance | £11,440/yr (4 hrs/wk) | £4,290 (1.5 hrs/wk) | **£7,150** |
| File review support | £14,300/yr (5 hrs/wk) | £5,720 (2 hrs/wk) | **£8,580** |
| **Total time savings** | | | **£42,350/yr** |

### Risk-Adjusted Value

| Risk Category | Probability × Impact | With AfrexAI Governance |
|---|---|---|
| FCA enforcement action (missed reg change) | 5% × £200K = £10K expected | Reduced to 1% = £2K |
| SM&CR personal sanction (undocumented AI) | 8% × £100K = £8K expected | Reduced to 1% = £1K |
| Consumer Duty failing (evidence gaps) | 10% × £150K = £15K expected | Reduced to 2% = £3K |
| **Total risk reduction** | **£33K expected annual loss** | **£6K → £27K saved** |

### Total Annual Value: ~£69K (conservative)
### Year 1 ROI: -43% (investment year), Year 2+: 58% annual return
### Breakeven: ~21 months

*Note: These are conservative estimates. For firms with higher regulatory complexity (multiple FCA permissions, cross-border), savings scale significantly.*

## Proof Points

- **FCA 2026 AI Review**: The FCA has launched a formal review into AI's long-term impact on financial services, signalling enforcement is coming. Firms that build governance now have a first-mover advantage (Source: Hogan Lovells, Jan 2026)
- **SM&CR + AI liability**: "Delegating a task to an algorithm no longer absolves a Senior Manager of responsibility for its outcome" — explicit 2026 mandate (Source: Formiti/FCA analysis, Jan 2026)
- **BCC AI Gap**: 89% of UK businesses using AI aren't seeing operational impact. Only 11% use it "to a great extent" (Source: BCC via Air IT Group, Feb 2026)
- **BCLP Guidance**: MPs pressed regulators on audit trails and human-in-the-loop; guidance expected in 2026 (Source: BCLP parliamentary analysis)
- **Gartner Consolidation**: 70% of enterprises will consolidate onto single automation platforms by 2030 — early movers in AI orchestration consulting have a 4-year land-grab window

## Talking Points for Christina

1. **"The FCA isn't asking if you're using AI — they're asking if you can explain it."** Most FCA-regulated SMEs are already using AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, even AI in their CRM). But zero governance means Senior Managers are personally liable for decisions they don't even know AI is making. We build the governance layer.

2. **"Consumer Duty killed the quarterly panic."** Every quarter, compliance teams spend 40+ hours assembling Consumer Duty board reports from fragmented data. Our system does continuous evidence collection — the quarterly report writes itself. That's 120 hours/year back.

3. **"The FCA issued 140+ documents last year. How many did your compliance team actually read?"** We don't replace your compliance officer — we make them superhuman. Automated regulatory monitoring, impact assessment, and policy drafting means nothing falls through the cracks.

4. **"Your competitors are building AI governance now. When the FCA starts asking questions — and they will in 2026 — who's going to be ready?"** This is a land-grab moment. First firms to have documented, auditable AI governance will set the standard. The rest will be playing catch-up under enforcement pressure.

5. **"£120K sounds like a lot until you price in the £33K annual risk exposure you're carrying today, plus the £42K in compliance labour you're burning."** Breakeven in 21 months, and you've built an asset that compounds — every new regulation, every new AI tool, every FCA request gets easier.
