## Vertical & Scenario

**Target persona:** Marketing Director or BD Partner at a mid-size professional services firm (20-200 people). Law firms, accountancy practices, management consultancies — anyone where credibility drives revenue.

**Day-to-day reality:** They know thought leadership wins clients. Every partner has expertise worth sharing. But getting a 1,200-word article out of a senior partner is like extracting teeth. Partners bill at £300-500/hour. Every hour spent writing is an hour not billed. Marketing teams chase partners for months to produce a single piece.

## The Pain

**Quantified bottleneck:**
- Average professional services firm aims for 2-4 thought leadership pieces per month
- Each piece requires: 2-3 hours of partner input (interviews, review, approval) + 4-6 hours of marketing/writing time
- At a blended partner rate of £400/hr, that's £800-1,200 of unbilled time per article
- Marketing coordinator time: ~20 hrs/month on content production at £25/hr = £500/month
- **Total cost per article: £1,500-£2,000** (mostly in lost billable time)
- Most firms produce far less than they plan — 60% of planned content never ships

**Thomson Reuters 2026 data confirms the gap:**
- Organization-wide AI usage in professional services doubled to 40% in 2026
- But only 18% track ROI on AI tools
- Firms are adopting AI ad hoc with no measurement framework
- Content and client communication are top use cases but poorly systematised

**The real cost:** Not just the articles themselves — it's the business development that *doesn't happen* because the firm is invisible. Prospects who never hear from them. Referrals that go to the firm that publishes weekly instead of quarterly.

## The Solution

AfrexAI builds an **AI-assisted thought leadership pipeline** that reduces partner time from 3 hours to 30 minutes per piece:

1. **15-minute voice capture** — Partner records a voice note about their topic (on mobile, in a taxi, between meetings). AI transcribes and structures it into a draft.
2. **AI-powered research enrichment** — Agent pulls relevant regulatory updates, market data, and case law to substantiate the partner's points. No more "I'll add the stats later" delays.
3. **Brand-consistent drafting** — AI produces a draft in the firm's voice, referencing their previous publications for tone consistency. Human editor polishes (30 min vs 4 hours).
4. **Multi-format repurposing** — One voice note becomes: long-form article, LinkedIn post, newsletter snippet, and client alert. 4x output from the same input.
5. **Publication scheduling** — Content calendar managed by AI agent, auto-distributing across channels on schedule.

## ROI Numbers

**Assumptions (conservative, 50-person law firm):**
- Current output: 2 articles/month (target was 4)
- Partner time saved: 2.5 hrs/article × 4 articles = 10 hrs/month
- Partner billable rate: £400/hr → **£4,000/month recovered billable time**
- Marketing time saved: 15 hrs/month → **£375/month**
- Content output doubles: 2 → 4 articles + 16 social posts from repurposing
- **Annual value: £52,500** in recovered time + doubled visibility

**Second-order effects:**
- Firms that publish weekly generate 3.5x more inbound enquiries than quarterly publishers (industry benchmark)
- Each additional quality article = potential £10K-50K+ in new instructions over 12 months
- Partner satisfaction increases — they contribute expertise without the writing burden

## Proof Points

- Thomson Reuters 2026: 40% of professional services firms now have org-wide AI adoption (doubled from 22% in 2025)
- 45% of law firms plan to make AI central to workflows within 2 years
- Passle (prospect, ICP 9) already proves the market — they exist specifically because professional services firms struggle with content. They've built a business on making it easier. We can make it *autonomous*.
- Edelman-LinkedIn B2B Thought Leadership Impact Study: 64% of C-suite say thought leadership is more effective than traditional marketing at building trust

## Talking Points for Christina

1. **"Your partners' expertise is your most valuable marketing asset — but it's locked in their heads."** We unlock it with a 15-minute voice note instead of a 3-hour writing session.

2. **"You're not competing on content quality. You're competing on content *consistency*."** The firm that publishes every week beats the firm that publishes a masterpiece once a quarter.

3. **"At £400/hour, every article costs you £1,500 in lost billable time."** We cut that to £200. That's £15,000+ back in your partners' billable hours every year.

4. **"Passle proved the market. We automate the last mile."** Content platforms help distribute — we help *create* at scale without burning partner time.

5. **"18% of firms measure AI ROI. Be in the 18%."** We build the measurement in from day one — you'll know exactly what your content pipeline returns.
