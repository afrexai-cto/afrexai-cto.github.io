# Discovery Call Scripts

## AfrexAI — Sales Discovery Framework | 2026

### Pre-Call Preparation (15 minutes)

Before every discovery call:
1. Research the company on Companies House (revenue, headcount, directors)
2. Check LinkedIn for the prospect's background, recent posts, mutual connections
3. Review their website for tech stack clues (Wappalyzer, BuiltWith)
4. Check news: recent funding, hiring, acquisitions, digital transformation mentions
5. Prepare 3 industry-specific AI use cases relevant to their sector

### The AfrexAI Discovery Framework: PAIN

**P — Problem**: What's broken, slow, or expensive?
**A — Ambition**: Where do they want to be in 12 months?
**I — Impact**: What happens if they don't solve this? What if they do?
**N — Next**: What's the logical next step?

### Opening Script (First 5 Minutes)

"Thanks for making time, [Name]. I've done some homework on [Company] — [specific observation about their business]. I'd love to understand more about where AI fits into your plans. But first, what prompted you to take this call?"

**Why this works:**
- Shows preparation (respect their time)
- Specific observation builds credibility
- Open question lets them frame the conversation
- "What prompted" reveals urgency and motivation

### Problem Discovery (10-15 Minutes)

**Process questions:**
- "Walk me through how [specific process] works today — start to finish."
- "Where do things slow down or break?"
- "How many people touch this process? What's their time worth?"
- "What happens when it goes wrong? What's the cost of errors?"

**Data questions:**
- "Where does your data live? How many systems?"
- "How do you currently use data to make decisions?"
- "What questions do you wish you could answer but can't today?"

**Previous attempts:**
- "Have you tried to solve this before? What happened?"
- "Have you looked at any AI tools or vendors?"
- "What's your team's experience with AI so far?"

### Ambition Mapping (5-10 Minutes)

- "If we fast-forward 12 months, what does success look like?"
- "What would change in your business if this problem was solved?"
- "Is this a board-level priority or a departmental initiative?"
- "What's driving the timeline? Is there an event or deadline?"

### Impact Quantification (5 Minutes)

- "How much time does your team spend on [process] per week?"
- "What's the revenue impact of [problem] per quarter?"
- "If we could cut that by 50%, what would that mean in pounds?"
- "What's the cost of doing nothing for another 6 months?"

**Always quantify in £.** Vague problems don't get budgets.

### Budget & Authority (5 Minutes)

Don't ask "What's your budget?" Instead:
- "Projects like this typically range from £15K-£50K depending on scope. Does that align with what you had in mind?"
- "Who else would need to be involved in a decision like this?"
- "What does your approval process look like for technology investments?"
- "Have you allocated budget for AI initiatives this year?"

### Closing & Next Steps (5 Minutes)

**If qualified:**
"Based on what you've shared, I think we can help. Here's what I'd suggest: a 2-week Discovery Sprint where we assess your AI readiness and map out the top 3 opportunities. That's £5,000 and you'll have a concrete roadmap. I'll send over the proposal tomorrow — can we book a follow-up for Thursday to walk through it?"

**If not quite ready:**
"It sounds like you're in the early stages of thinking about this. Let me send you our AI Readiness Guide — it'll help you think through the key questions internally. Happy to reconnect in [timeframe] when you've had a chance to review."

**If not a fit:**
"I appreciate your transparency. Based on what you've described, I don't think we're the right fit right now — [honest reason]. I'd suggest [alternative]. Happy to reconnect if things change."

### Objection Handling During Discovery

**"We're just exploring"**
→ "Totally understand. That's exactly what this call is for. Let me ask — what would need to be true for you to move forward with an AI project this quarter?"

**"We've been burned by consultants before"**
→ "Fair concern. What went wrong? ... We structure everything around measurable outcomes. Our Discovery Sprint has a clear deliverable — if it doesn't add value, you'll know in 2 weeks, not 6 months."

**"Can you just send a proposal?"**
→ "I could, but I'd rather make sure it's tailored to your situation. A generic proposal wastes both our time. Can I ask 3 more questions so I can make it specific?"

### Post-Call Process

1. Send thank-you email within 2 hours (reference specific points discussed)
2. Log call notes in CRM: PAIN framework summary, qualification score (1-5)
3. Draft proposal if qualified (send within 24 hours)
4. Set follow-up task: 48 hours for qualified, 2 weeks for nurture
5. Update pipeline forecast

### Call Quality Scorecard

Rate each call 1-5:
- Did I listen more than talk? (Target: 70/30 ratio)
- Did I quantify the problem in £?
- Did I identify the decision-maker?
- Did I establish a clear next step?
- Did I uncover the real motivation (not just the stated one)?
