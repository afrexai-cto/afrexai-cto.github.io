# AI Consulting Frameworks

## AfrexAI — Consulting Methodology for £1M ARR | 2026

### The AfrexAI Consulting Stack

Three-phase engagement model designed for UK mid-market companies (£5M-£100M revenue):

**Phase 1: AI Readiness Assessment (Week 1-2)**
- Data infrastructure audit: What systems exist? Where does data live? Quality score 1-10
- Process mapping: Identify top 10 time-consuming workflows across departments
- Technology stack review: Current tools, integration capabilities, API availability
- Team capability assessment: Digital literacy, change readiness, internal champions
- Output: AI Readiness Scorecard (0-100) with prioritised opportunity map

**Phase 2: Opportunity Sizing & Roadmap (Week 3-4)**
- ROI modelling per use case (minimum 3 high-impact opportunities)
- Build vs buy analysis for each opportunity
- Resource requirements: internal team, AfrexAI delivery, third-party tools
- Risk assessment: data privacy (UK GDPR), bias, operational disruption
- Output: 90-day AI Implementation Roadmap with phased milestones

**Phase 3: Pilot & Prove (Week 5-12)**
- Build one production-ready AI solution from the roadmap
- Measure baseline → post-implementation metrics
- Document savings, efficiency gains, revenue impact
- Create internal playbook for the client team
- Output: Business case for scaling AI across the organisation
