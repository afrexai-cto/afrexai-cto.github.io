# ROI Calculators for AI Projects

## AfrexAI — Proving Value in Pounds | 2026

### Why ROI Calculation Wins Deals

UK mid-market buyers are pragmatic. They don't buy "AI" — they buy outcomes. Every proposal must include a credible ROI calculation. The goal: make the investment decision obvious.

**Rule of thumb**: If you can't show 3x ROI within 12 months, the project isn't ready.

### The AfrexAI ROI Framework

```
Net ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100

Payback Period = Total Investment / Monthly Benefit

Annual Value = (Time Saved × Hourly Cost) + Revenue Gained + Error Costs Avoided
```

### Calculator 1: Process Automation ROI

**Inputs:**
- Number of employees doing the task: ___
- Hours per week per employee on task: ___
- Average fully loaded salary (UK): £___/year
- Error rate in current process: ___%
- Cost per error: £___

**Calculation:**
```
Hourly cost = Annual salary / 1,820 (UK working hours)
Weekly cost of task = Employees × Hours × Hourly cost
Annual cost = Weekly cost × 48 (working weeks)
AI automation savings (conservative 60%) = Annual cost × 0.6
Error reduction savings = Errors/year × Cost per error × 0.8
Total annual benefit = Automation savings + Error savings
```

**Example: Legal contract review**
- 3 paralegals × 15 hours/week × £25/hour = £1,125/week
- Annual cost: £54,000
- AI savings (60%): £32,400
- Error reduction: £8,000
- **Total annual benefit: £40,400**
- AfrexAI project cost: £25,000
- **Payback: 7.4 months | ROI: 62% Year 1**

### Calculator 2: Customer Service AI ROI

**Inputs:**
- Monthly support tickets: ___
- Average handling time (minutes): ___
- Cost per agent hour: £___
- Customer churn attributed to slow response: ___%
- Average customer lifetime value: £___

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly support cost = Tickets × (AHT/60) × Agent hourly cost
AI deflection rate (target 40%): Monthly savings = Cost × 0.4
Churn reduction value = Churn improvement × Customers × LTV × 0.1
Annual benefit = (Monthly savings + Churn value) × 12
```

**Example: E-commerce support**
- 2,000 tickets/month × 12 min × £18/hour = £7,200/month
- AI deflection (40%): £2,880/month savings
- Churn reduction: £1,500/month
- **Annual benefit: £52,560**
- AfrexAI project cost: £30,000
- **Payback: 6.8 months | ROI: 75% Year 1**

### Calculator 3: Knowledge Management ROI

**Inputs:**
- Knowledge workers in organisation: ___
- Hours per week searching for information: ___
- Average salary: £___
- Decisions delayed due to missing information per month: ___
- Cost of delayed decision: £___

**Calculation:**
```
Search time cost = Workers × Hours × Hourly rate × 48 weeks
AI reduction in search time (50%): Annual savings
Decision delay cost = Delays × Cost × 12 months × 0.5 improvement
Total annual benefit = Search savings + Decision savings
```

### Calculator 4: Sales Intelligence ROI

**Inputs:**
- Sales team size: ___
- Average deal value: £___
- Current win rate: ___%
- Deals per quarter: ___
- Hours per week on admin/research: ___

**Calculation:**
```
Current quarterly revenue = Deals × Win rate × Deal value
AI-improved win rate (+15%): New quarterly revenue
Revenue uplift = New revenue - Current revenue
Time savings = Team × Admin hours × Hourly cost × 0.5
Annual benefit = (Revenue uplift + Time savings) × 4
```

### Presenting ROI to Different Stakeholders

**To the CFO:**
- Focus on payback period and cash flow impact
- Show conservative, realistic, and optimistic scenarios
- Include implementation costs, ongoing costs, and hidden costs
- Compare to alternative investments (hiring, outsourcing)

**To the CEO:**
- Lead with strategic impact and competitive advantage
- Show market benchmarks ("your competitors are already doing this")
- Frame as revenue enabler, not just cost reduction
- Include timeline to results

**To the CTO/IT Director:**
- Focus on integration effort and technical risk
- Show total cost of ownership (TCO) over 3 years
- Address security, data privacy, and maintenance
- Compare build vs buy scenarios

### Conservative vs Optimistic Projections

Always present three scenarios in proposals:
- **Conservative (60% of estimated benefit)**: Use this as the headline
- **Realistic (100%)**: The expected outcome based on benchmarks
- **Optimistic (140%)**: Stretch scenario with full adoption

**Never oversell.** Under-promise, over-deliver. UK buyers respect honesty.

### Common ROI Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Counting 100% of time saved as cash savings** — people don't get fired, they do other work
2. **Ignoring implementation disruption** — there's always a productivity dip
3. **Forgetting ongoing costs** — API costs, maintenance, model updates
4. **Using US benchmarks for UK market** — salaries and costs differ significantly
5. **Not accounting for adoption curve** — benefits ramp up over 3-6 months
