## Vertical & Scenario

**Target Persona:** Head of Fundraising / Operations Director at a mid-size UK charity (10-80 staff, £2M-£20M annual income). They manage donor relationships through a CRM (often Beacon, Salesforce Nonprofit, or Donorfy), coordinate campaigns, write grant applications, and produce trustee reports.

**Day-to-day:** Juggling donor acknowledgements, gift processing, campaign segmentation, impact reporting, and grant compliance — mostly manually. Staff are mission-driven but time-poor. Tech budgets are tight. Data lives in silos (CRM, email, spreadsheets, finance system).

## The Pain

The 2026 Virtuous AI Adoption Report (346 orgs, Feb 2026) reveals:

- **92% of nonprofits use AI** but **only 7% report major mission impact** — the vast majority are stuck at "faster drafts"
- **81% use AI ad hoc** with no documented workflows
- **47% have no AI governance policy** — especially dangerous with donor PII
- **65% describe use as reactive and individual** — not embedded in operations

**Quantified for a 30-person charity:**
- **Donor communications:** 15 hrs/week drafting thank-yous, updates, appeals manually → ~£18K/year in staff time (£23/hr loaded)
- **Reporting:** 8 hrs/week pulling data from multiple systems for trustee/funder reports → ~£9,600/year
- **Prospect research:** 5 hrs/week manual research on major gift prospects → ~£6,000/year
- **Data hygiene:** 4 hrs/week deduplicating, cleaning, reconciling records → ~£4,800/year
- **Total addressable waste: ~£38,400/year** in a 30-person org

## The Solution

AfrexAI deploys AI agents embedded into the charity's existing workflow:

1. **Donor Communication Agent** — Drafts personalised thank-yous, campaign updates, and appeal letters using donor history and giving patterns from CRM. Staff review and send. Cuts drafting time by 70%.

2. **Reporting Agent** — Pulls data from CRM + finance system, generates trustee-ready impact reports and funder compliance reports automatically. Weekly/monthly cadence.

3. **Prospect Research Agent** — Deep-dives on major gift prospects: wealth indicators, giving history, board connections, philanthropic interests. Produces briefing packs before cultivation meetings.

4. **Data Steward Agent** — Continuous CRM hygiene: deduplication, address verification, lapsed donor flagging, gift aid eligibility checks.

5. **Governance Framework** — Unlike DIY AI adoption, AfrexAI provides the governance layer (what's encouraged, what needs approval, what's off-limits with donor data) that 47% of nonprofits are missing.

## ROI Numbers (Conservative)

| Category | Current Cost | AI Reduction | Annual Saving |
|---|---|---|---|
| Donor communications | £18,000 | 60% | £10,800 |
| Reporting | £9,600 | 70% | £6,720 |
| Prospect research | £6,000 | 50% | £3,000 |
| Data hygiene | £4,800 | 65% | £3,120 |
| **Total** | **£38,400** | | **£23,640** |

**Assumptions:** 30-person charity, £23/hr loaded cost, conservative automation rates (not full replacement — staff review everything).

**Payback:** At AfrexAI's engagement price point, ROI within 2-3 months. Staff time freed redirects to donor relationships — the highest-value activity.

## Proof Points

- **92% adoption, 7% impact** (Virtuous 2026 Report, n=346) — massive gap = massive opportunity for guided implementation
- **81% ad hoc usage** — organisations desperately need structured AI workflows, not more tools
- **Beacon CRM** (prospect in our pipeline, ICP score 9) serves exactly this market — potential partnership angle
- UK charity sector: 170,000+ registered charities, ~10,000 with income >£1M = addressable market
- Charity Commission digital transformation push ongoing since 2024

## Talking Points for Christina

1. "92% of charities are already using AI, but only 7% are seeing real impact. We close that gap — we don't sell tools, we embed AI into your actual workflows with proper governance."

2. "Your donor data is sacred. 47% of nonprofits using AI have zero governance policy around it. We build the guardrails first, then the automation."

3. "We typically save a 30-person charity £20K+ per year in staff time — and that time goes back into donor relationships, which is where the real fundraising ROI lives."

4. "Most AI adoption in charities is individual — one person using ChatGPT. We make it organisational — documented workflows, shared across teams, measurable outcomes."

5. "We've studied the Beacon CRM ecosystem specifically. We know how charity data flows and where the bottlenecks are."
