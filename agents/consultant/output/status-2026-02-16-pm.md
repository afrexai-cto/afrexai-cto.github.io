## Use Case Researched

**Financial Services: AI Governance & Compliance Automation**

Targeted UK FCA-regulated SMEs (IFAs, wealth managers, fintechs) facing the 2026 AI accountability shift. The FCA has moved from principles to enforcement — SM&CR now explicitly makes Senior Managers personally liable for AI decisions, and human-in-the-loop guidance is expected this year.

## Key Findings

1. **Regulatory urgency is real**: FCA launched formal AI review Jan 2026. This isn't hypothetical anymore — enforcement is coming.
2. **The governance vacuum**: 81% of businesses using AI have zero documented workflows. For FCA-regulated firms, that's personal liability for every Senior Manager.
3. **Consumer Duty is the wedge**: Quarterly evidence reports taking 40 hours manually — automatable to 10. Immediate, tangible pain relief.
4. **ROI stacks up**: £69K annual value (labour + risk reduction) vs £120K implementation. 21-month breakeven.

## Surprising Insight

The biggest selling point isn't efficiency — it's **personal liability protection**. Under SM&CR, a Senior Manager can be personally sanctioned if AI tools cause harm and they didn't take "reasonable steps." Most don't even know which AI tools their staff are using. The governance framework we'd build is essentially professional indemnity in operational form.

## Emerging Pattern

Across all four verticals researched (nonprofit, professional services, legal, financial services), the same pattern emerges: **governance is the differentiator, not automation.** Everyone can deploy ChatGPT. Almost nobody can document, audit, and govern it. AfrexAI's consulting-led approach positions us to sell the governance layer that makes AI deployable — not just the AI itself.

## Tomorrow's Priorities

- **Construction vertical** is the last major gap — needs fresh 2026 data on site reporting automation, Building Safety Act compliance
- If Strategist provides prospect briefs, pivot to discovery call prep
- Consider cross-vertical "AI Governance Readiness" framework that applies to all sectors — this is clearly the horizontal play
