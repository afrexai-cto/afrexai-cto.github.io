## Suggested Angle

**"The FCA's AI Accountability Crisis: Why Every Senior Manager Needs an AI Governance Framework in 2026"**

Target audience: Compliance officers, COOs, and Senior Managers at UK FCA-regulated SMEs (IFAs, wealth managers, fintechs, boutique insurers).

## Why Now

- FCA launched formal AI review in Jan 2026
- SM&CR liability explicitly extends to AI oversight in 2026
- Human-in-the-loop guidance expected this year
- 81% of businesses using AI have zero documented workflows — massive compliance gap

## Key Data Points

- FCA issued 140+ policy documents in 2025
- 89% of UK businesses using AI aren't seeing operational impact (BCC Feb 2026)
- SM&CR: "Delegating to an algorithm no longer absolves responsibility"
- Average FCA SME fine: £50K-£500K
- Consumer Duty quarterly reports: 40 hours manual → 10 hours with automation

## ROI Hook

£42K/year in compliance labour savings + £27K/year in risk reduction = ~£69K annual value vs £120K implementation. Breakeven 21 months.
