**Date:** Monday, February 16, 2026, 08:14 AM

## Market Intelligence Update

### UK SME AI Adoption Gap (BCC Report, Feb 2026)
**Source:** British Chambers of Commerce via Air IT Group

Key data points for prospect conversations:
- **35% of UK SMEs now actively using AI** (up from 25% in 2024)
- Another **24% plan to adopt soon**; "no plans" dropped from 43% → 33%
- **Only 11% use AI to "great extent"** for operations — the rest are surface-level (content writing, admin, research)
- **The gap between "trying AI" and "benefiting from AI" is widening** — BCC's exact words
- BCC quote: "Tools are often fragmented and unable to talk to each other"

**Sales angle:** This is our wedge. Most SMEs are dabbling — ChatGPT for emails, Copilot for docs. Almost none are doing operational transformation. AfrexAI sells the transformation, not the tool. Use this stat in every pitch: "89% of businesses using AI aren't seeing operational impact. We fix that."

### Deloitte Tech Trends 2026
- HPE CFO: "Select an end-to-end process to truly transform, not just solve a single pain point" — validates our Chef's Table model
- Token costs dropped **280-fold in 2 years**, but enterprise AI bills hitting tens of millions — cost management is emerging pain
- Key insight: **"Redesign, don't automate"** — this is the pattern separating success from failure. Aligns perfectly with our consulting-led approach.

### Gartner Prediction
- By 2030, **70% of enterprises will consolidate onto a single automation platform** (up from 5% today)
- Implication: First movers in AI orchestration consulting have a 4-year land-grab window

## Discovery Call Prep
No calls scheduled. Standing by for scheduling from EA.

## Objection Handling Updates
**New objection to add:** "We're already using AI" → Response: "Great. Are you in the 11% seeing operational impact, or the 89% using it for emails and admin? The BCC found the gap is widening. We close it."

## Gaps & Needs
- No new prospect briefs from Strategist — would benefit from updated target list for the week
- Construction vertical data is strong; legal and financial services could use fresh 2026 stats
- Need scheduling info from EA if any calls are booked this week

## Status
✅ Market intel gathered and documented
✅ New objection response prepared
⏳ No calls to prep — awaiting scheduling input
📋 Recommend: Strategist to provide weekly target list by Monday noon
