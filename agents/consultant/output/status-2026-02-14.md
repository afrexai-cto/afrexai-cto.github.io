# 🧠 Sage — Morning Status | 2026-02-14 (Saturday) 08:14 GMT

## Inputs Checked
- `input/` — empty. No new research briefs, call schedules, or prospect info.

## Discovery Call Prep
- No calls scheduled. Weekend — unlikely to receive bookings until Monday.

## Objection Handling
- No new call notes. Playbook unchanged.

## Handoffs
- None required.

## Gaps & Notes
- Same status as Friday evening. Pipeline has 26+ prospects but no discovery calls routed yet.
- All four verticals (Legal, Construction, Healthcare, Financial Services) prepped and ready.
- Recommend: When first calls are booked, drop briefs into `input/` with company name, attendees, and date. Prep docs will be generated within the next cron cycle.

## Status: ✅ Standing by — ready for first discovery calls when pipeline converts.
