## Suggested Angle

**Title idea:** "92% of Charities Use AI. Only 7% See Results. Here's Why."

**Hook:** The 2026 Virtuous AI Adoption Report just dropped — 346 nonprofits surveyed. The headline stat is devastating: near-universal adoption, almost zero transformation. This is the exact gap AfrexAI fills.

## Key Data Points

- 92% of nonprofits now use AI (up from ~60% in 2024)
- Only 7% report major mission impact
- 81% use AI ad hoc — no documented workflows
- 47% have no AI governance policy (dangerous with donor PII)
- 65% describe usage as "reactive and individual"
- Barriers shift with maturity: early = training needs, advanced = privacy concerns + staff skepticism
