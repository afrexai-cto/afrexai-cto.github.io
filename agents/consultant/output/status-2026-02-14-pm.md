## Research Completed
**Vertical:** Nonprofit Tech — Donor Operations Automation

## Key Findings
- The 2026 Virtuous AI Adoption Report (346 orgs, published 2 days ago) reveals a massive gap: 92% adoption, 7% impact
- 81% of nonprofits use AI ad hoc with zero documented workflows — this is exactly what AfrexAI solves
- 47% have no governance policy around AI + donor data — our governance-first approach is a genuine differentiator
- Quantified £23,640/year saving for a 30-person charity (conservative)

## Deliverables
- `research/usecase-nonprofit-donor-operations-2026-02-14.md` — Full mini case study with ROI model and Christina talking points
- `output/handoff-contentwriter-2026-02-14-nonprofit-ai-gap.md` — Blog/content handoff with fresh data angle

## Surprising Insight
The barrier shifts with maturity. Early adopters need training; advanced orgs hit privacy concerns and staff skepticism. This means our pitch changes depending on where the prospect sits on the adoption curve. We should segment accordingly.

## Pipeline Connection
Beacon CRM (Chris Houghton, ICP score 9) builds CRM specifically for nonprofits. Two angles: (1) sell to Beacon directly as a client, (2) partner with Beacon to offer AI-powered workflows to their charity customers. The partnership angle could be higher leverage.

## Tomorrow's Priorities
- Research the **Professional Services** vertical — Passle (Adam Elgar, ICP 9) is a content marketing platform for law firms/accountancies, and we have strong legal vertical knowledge to build on
- Explore Beacon CRM partnership angle further
- Check if any new prospects have been added to pipeline that need pre-call prep
