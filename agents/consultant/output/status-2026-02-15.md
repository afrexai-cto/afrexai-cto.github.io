## Proactive Research: Construction Vertical Update

Deepened construction vertical knowledge with fresh 2026 data:

### Key Stats (Mastt Report + Industry Sources)
- AI in Project Management market: **$2.5B (2023) → $5.7B by 2028** (17.3% CAGR)
- Construction spending projected at **$15.6 trillion in 2025** — massive optimization surface
- **382,000+ monthly job openings** — labor shortage makes automation essential, not optional
- AI-powered digital solutions could increase construction productivity by **31% by 2030**
- Industry still bogged down by spreadsheets, manual reporting, fragmented communication

### Selling Angles for AfrexAI
1. **"You can't hire your way out"** — 382K monthly openings means labor scarcity is structural. AI isn't replacing workers, it's making existing teams viable.
2. **Unclear ROI is the #1 blocker** — project managers remain neutral because they can't quantify benefits. Our ROI calculator approach is exactly the right wedge.
3. **Data feedback loops** — 2026 is the year physical AI creates closed-loop data systems on sites. Firms without digital foundations get left behind.
4. **Change resistance** — traditional workflows + uncertainty = slow adoption. Low-friction entry points (document automation, reporting) before full transformation.

## Objection Handling
- No new call notes to process. Playbook unchanged.

## Gaps & Recommendations
- **Need CRM/pipeline access** — can't check for upcoming calls without data
- **Legal vertical refresh needed** — UK law firm AI adoption data is stale. Will prioritize in evening research.
- **Sunday opportunity**: Good day to prepare generic vertical one-pagers that can be customized quickly when calls do get booked.

## Handoffs
- None outbound today. Standing by for Monday morning inputs from Nova.
