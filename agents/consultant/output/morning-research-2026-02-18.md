## 2. Market Intelligence Update: Financial Services AI Governance

### New Findings (Fresh This Week)
The regulatory pressure on UK financial services AI usage has **escalated significantly** since my last research on Feb 16:

1. **Treasury Committee Report (Jan 2026)** — Published inquiry finding UK exposed to "serious harm" by failure to tackle AI risks. Called for **prescriptive regulation for financial advice firms on acceptable AI usage by end of 2026**. This is no longer guidance — it's a mandate timeline.

2. **Kennedys Law (Feb 2026)** — New analysis confirms "dual compliance framework" required: FCA conduct/governance obligations + data protection. Firms need to embed AI within existing SYSC, SM&CR and Consumer Duty frameworks simultaneously.

3. **FCA COCON Extension (Sep 2026)** — Code of Conduct sourcebook expanding to cover serious work-related non-financial misconduct. Combined with AI oversight, this widens the accountability net for senior managers.

4. **Guardian (11 Feb 2026)** — UK wealth manager shares falling on AI fears. Anthropic announced tools automating legal/compliance work — spooking traditional firms. This creates **urgency AND fear** — perfect buying conditions.

5. **EY Regulatory Outlook 2026** — "Firms must prioritize regulatory adherence and compliance for AI in each jurisdiction." Big 4 pushing compliance-first messaging = validates our positioning.

### Updated Thesis
The window for AI governance consulting in UK financial services is **narrowing to action**. The Treasury Committee has set end-of-2026 as the deadline for prescriptive rules. Firms that aren't preparing now will be scrambling in Q3-Q4.

**Our pitch**: "The FCA isn't waiting. The Treasury Committee just set a 2026 deadline for AI-specific rules. We help you build the governance framework now, before enforcement catches up."

## 3. Prospect Analysis: Top 5 for Outreach

From CRM, prioritising wealth management + regional banks (US-based, but AI governance is universal):

### Tier 1 — Best Fit (Wealth Management, 300-450 employees)
| Company | Contact | Title | Why |
|---------|---------|-------|-----|
| **Allworth Financial** | Scott Hanson | Co-Founder | Sacramento, 350 emp. Consumer-facing wealth mgmt = highest compliance burden. Co-founder = decision maker. |
| **Carson Group** | Ron Carson | Founder & CEO | Omaha, 400 emp. Major RIA, high-profile founder. Would be a flagship client. |
| **Cerity Partners** | Kurt Miscinski | CEO | NYC, 400 emp. Multi-family office + institutional — complex compliance needs. |

### Tier 2 — Strong Fit (Regional Banks)
| Company | Contact | Title | Why |
|---------|---------|-------|-----|
| **Alerus Financial** | Katie Lorenson | President & CEO | 350 emp, Grand Forks. Bank + wealth + retirement = triple regulatory surface. |
| **Triumph Financial** | Aaron Graft | CEO | Dallas, 400 emp. Fintech-forward bank = likely already using AI = needs governance. |

### Tier 3 — Fintech (Higher risk, higher reward)
| Company | Contact | Title | Why |
|---------|---------|-------|-----|
| **AltExchange** | James Taylor | CEO | Nashville, 60 emp. Alternative investment platform — exactly the size that can't afford in-house compliance teams. |
| **Riskalyze** | Aaron Klein | CEO | 200 emp. Risk assessment tool for advisors — they'd be selling TO firms that need governance. Partnership angle. |

## 4. Draft Outreach Angles

### For Wealth Management (Allworth, Carson, Cerity)
**Subject:** "AI governance before the FCA catches up"
**Hook:** Treasury Committee just set 2026 deadline for prescriptive AI rules in financial advice. Over 75% of UK FS firms already using AI — most without documented governance.
**Offer:** 30-min AI governance readiness assessment — identify gaps before regulation crystallises.
**Differentiator:** We build the framework AND the automation. Not just a consultant report that sits on a shelf.

### For Regional Banks (Alerus, Triumph)
**Subject:** "Your AI is probably unauditable — here's the fix"
**Hook:** SM&CR liability now extends to AI oversight. If your senior managers can't explain how AI makes decisions, they're personally exposed.
**Offer:** AI audit trail implementation — 10-hour sprint to documented governance.

### For Fintech (AltExchange, Riskalyze)
**Subject:** "Your clients will ask about AI governance this year"
**Hook:** FCA-regulated clients are being pushed to document AI usage. If your platform can demonstrate governance compliance, you're a preferred vendor.
**Offer:** Partnership / white-label governance module conversation.

## 5. Gaps & Needs

- **No discovery calls booked** — all research is speculative until pipeline moves. Need EA/Hunter to activate outreach to Tier 1 prospects.
- **Deals table empty** — even warm conversations (VADIS, PremGrp, BuildGrid) aren't logged as deals. This needs fixing.
- **US vs UK angle** — CRM is US-heavy but my deepest research is UK/FCA. Need to research SEC/FINRA AI guidance for US wealth managers to make outreach relevant.
- **Evening research request:** Deep dive into US financial regulator AI positions (SEC, FINRA, OCC) to match the UK intel.

## 6. Handoffs

- **To Hunter/EA:** Tier 1 prospect list above ready for outreach activation
- **To Content Writer:** Treasury Committee findings + "AI governance deadline" angle ready for blog post / LinkedIn content
- **To Strategist:** Riskalyze partnership angle worth exploring — they sell risk tools to the exact firms that need governance
