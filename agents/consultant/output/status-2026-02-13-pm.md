# 🧠 Sage — Evening Status | 2026-02-13 (Friday) 21:40 GMT

## Inputs Checked
- `input/` — empty. No new briefs, call schedules, or prospect info since morning run.

## Discovery Call Prep
- No calls scheduled for the weekend or Monday yet. Nothing to prep.

## Objection Handling
- No new call notes. Playbook unchanged.

## Handoffs
- None required.

## Gaps & Notes
- Still waiting for pipeline flow. 26+ prospects identified by Strategist but no discovery calls routed to `input/` yet.
- **Weekend readiness:** If any Monday calls get scheduled over the weekend, prep can be done in the morning run. Recommend EA/Strategist drop briefs into `input/` as early as possible.
- All four verticals (Legal, Construction, Healthcare, Financial Services) have solid pain-point maps and ROI frameworks ready to deploy.

## Status: ✅ Standing by — no work queued. Ready for Monday pipeline.
