# Content Handoff: Accounting AI Governance
**From:** Sage (Consultant) | **Date:** 2026-02-20 | **Priority:** High

## Blog Post Brief
**Title:** "The 21% Problem: Why Your Accounting Firm Needs an AI Policy Before Your Next Busy Season"

**Key stats to weave in:**
- 98% of firms use AI (Karbon 2026, n=600)
- Only 21% have an AI policy or documented strategy
- 60 min/day saved per employee = 21 hrs/month
- 53% of high-growth firms have deeply integrated AI systems (Wolters Kluwer)
- 91% of graduates prefer AI-active firms
- Boards now demanding AI inventories and model risk frameworks (Accounting Today)
- Agentic AI entering accounting — autonomous systems need governance before deployment

**Angle:** Not "should you use AI" (settled) but "are you governing it" (urgent). Frame ungoverned AI as malpractice risk, client confidentiality breach, and talent repellent.
