## Research Focus: FINRA 2026 AI Governance (US Financial Services)

### Key Finding: FINRA Dedicates Entire Section to GenAI for First Time

FINRA's 2026 Annual Regulatory Oversight Report (released Dec 9, 2025) is a **game-changer** for our US wealth management prospects. This closes the research gap I flagged on Feb 18.

**What changed:**
- FINRA now has a **dedicated GenAI section** — first time ever. AI outputs create regulatory, legal, privacy, and information security risks requiring same rigor as traditional systems.
- **Regulation S-P compliance deadline**: Smaller firms must comply by **June 3, 2026** (written incident response, breach notification, enhanced safeguards). This is 3.5 months away.
- **Recordkeeping deficiencies** mentioned 50+ times in the report — CRM and communications archival under intense scrutiny.
- FINRA remains "technology-neutral" but with **heightened expectations** for scalable, risk-aligned supervision of AI tools.
- **Smarsh analysis**: AI is moving from experimentation to "operational dependency" — firms using AI without governance frameworks are exposed.

### US Regulatory Landscape (Mapped)

| Regulator | AI Position | Deadline |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| FINRA | Dedicated GenAI section in 2026 oversight report | Ongoing exams |
| SEC/Reg S-P | Enhanced cybersecurity + incident response | June 3, 2026 (small firms) |
| FinCEN | Investment advisers now classified as "financial institutions" under BSA | Jan 1, 2026 (LIVE) |
| FSI | Advocating RIA modernization + balanced AML/CFT | 2026 advocacy cycle |

### Implication for AfrexAI

This is the **US equivalent** of the UK FCA/SM&CR pressure we already documented. Combined narrative:

> "Whether you're FCA-regulated in the UK or FINRA-registered in the US, 2026 is the year AI governance goes from optional to mandatory. The firms that build frameworks now will be audit-ready. The firms that wait will be case studies."

## Priority Prospects — Wealth Management (CRM)

Top 5 by size/fit for AI governance pitch:

| Company | Contact | Title | Employees | Location |
|---------|---------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Mariner Wealth Advisors | Marty Bicknell | CEO | 450 | Overland Park, KS |
| Cerity Partners | Kurt Miscinski | CEO | 400 | New York, NY |
| EP Wealth Advisors | Patrick Goshtigian | CEO | 400 | Torrance, CA |
| Moneta Group | — | — | 350 | St. Louis, MO |
| Pathstone | — | — | 350 | Englewood, NJ |

**Recommended approach:** Lead with FINRA 2026 GenAI section + June 3 Reg S-P deadline. These are large enough to feel regulatory pressure but small enough to lack dedicated AI governance teams.

## Gaps to Fill (Evening Research)

1. Need Moneta Group and Pathstone CEO contacts — not in CRM
2. SEC's specific stance on AI in investment advice (separate from FINRA)
3. Any FINRA enforcement actions related to AI in 2025-2026
