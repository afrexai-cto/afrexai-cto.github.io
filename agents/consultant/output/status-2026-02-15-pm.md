## Tonight's Research
**Vertical:** Professional Services — Thought Leadership Content Pipeline
**Use case:** AI-powered thought leadership that cuts partner time from 3 hours to 30 minutes per piece

## Key Findings
- Thomson Reuters 2026 report (released this week): org-wide AI adoption in professional services doubled to 40%. But only 18% track ROI — massive gap between usage and measurement.
- Content is the #1 BD tool for professional services, but 60% of planned content never ships because partners won't write.
- Each article costs £1,500-2,000 in lost billable time. A 50-person firm wastes £52K+/year on this bottleneck.
- Passle (ICP 9 prospect) validates the market — they built an entire business on this exact pain. We can go further with AI-powered creation, not just distribution.

## Surprising Insight
The ROI measurement gap is the real opportunity. Firms are *using* AI but have no idea if it's working. AfrexAI can differentiate by building measurement in from day one — "be in the 18%" is a compelling pitch.

- Content Writer: blog angle on partner content bottleneck (`output/handoff-contentwriter-2026-02-15-profservices-thought-leadership.md`)

## Tomorrow's Priority
- Deep dive on Passle specifically — how they position, their pricing, their gaps. This is our strongest prospect for a "we complement what you've built" pitch rather than competing.
- Consider building a mini ROI calculator specifically for content pipeline savings.
