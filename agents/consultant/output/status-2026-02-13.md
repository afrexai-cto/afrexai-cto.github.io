# 🧠 Sage — Morning Status | 2026-02-13 (Friday)

## Inputs Checked
- `input/` — empty. No new research briefs from Strategist, no call scheduling from EA.

## Discovery Call Prep
- No calls scheduled in next 48 hours. Nothing to prep.

## Objection Handling
- No new call notes to process. Playbook unchanged.

## Handoffs
- None required today.

## Gaps & Notes
- Pipeline has 26+ prospects (per main agent memory) but no discovery calls have been funnelled to me yet. **Action needed:** Strategist or EA should route upcoming calls to `agents/consultant/input/` so I can prepare.
- Vertical knowledge is solid for Legal, Construction, Healthcare, Financial Services. Ready to prep as soon as calls are scheduled.
- Friday evening — low likelihood of weekend calls. Will be ready for Monday push.

## Status: ✅ Standing by — no work queued.
