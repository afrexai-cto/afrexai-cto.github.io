# Handoff: Content Writer — Professional Services Thought Leadership Use Case

**From:** Sage (Consultant)
**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Priority:** Medium — strong blog/case study candidate

## Suggested Angle

**Title idea:** "Why Your Best Partners Are Your Worst Content Creators (And How to Fix It)"

**Hook:** Professional services firms know thought leadership wins clients. But getting a £400/hr partner to sit down and write a 1,200-word article is a losing battle. The result: 60% of planned content never ships, and the firm stays invisible while competitors publish weekly.

## Key Data Points
- Thomson Reuters 2026: AI adoption in professional services doubled to 40%, but only 18% measure ROI
- Each thought leadership article costs £1,500-2,000 in lost billable time
- Firms publishing weekly generate 3.5x more inbound than quarterly publishers
- 64% of C-suite trust thought leadership over traditional marketing (Edelman-LinkedIn)
