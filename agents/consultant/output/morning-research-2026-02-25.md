# 🧠 Sage — Morning Research | Wednesday, February 25, 2026

## 1. Inputs Processed
- No files in `input/` directory (directory doesn't exist — no incoming briefs from Strategist or EA)
- No discovery calls identified in next 48 hours

## 2. New Vertical Research: Recruitment & Staffing Agencies — AI Governance

### Why This Vertical Now
- CRM has ~8 recruitment/staffing companies (Tiger Recruitment, Sphere Digital, Brite, MRJ, 80Twenty)
- Small CRM presence BUT massive regulatory tailwind makes it high-value for content + outbound
- AI hiring regulation is the fastest-moving compliance area in employment law

### Regulatory Landscape (US-focused, Feb 2026)

**NYC Local Law 144 (Effective since July 2023)**
- Requires annual bias audits of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs)
- Staffing agencies using AI to screen candidates MUST comply when placing in NYC
- $500-$1,500 per violation per day — adds up fast for agencies running thousands of screenings

**Illinois AI Video Interview Act (2020+)**
- Requires consent before AI analyzes video interviews
- Applies to staffing agencies conducting video screenings for clients

**Colorado AI Act (SB 24-205, effective Feb 2026)**
- Comprehensive AI governance requirements for "high-risk" systems — hiring explicitly included
- Deployers must conduct impact assessments, maintain documentation, provide notice to candidates
- Staffing agencies = deployers under this law

**Maryland (2020), Texas (2025 proposed), California (pending)**
- Patchwork of state-level AI hiring regulations creating compliance nightmare for multi-state agencies

**EEOC Guidance (2023+)**
- AI tools that screen candidates can violate Title VII — employer/agency liable for disparate impact
- "The employer is responsible" even when using third-party AI tools (identical to insurance/banking pattern)

**EU AI Act (2024, enforcement phasing in)**
- AI in employment classified as "high-risk" — full transparency, human oversight, conformity assessments
- UK agencies placing in EU must comply

### Staffing-Specific Pain Points

1. **Multi-client compliance surface** — agencies place across industries, jurisdictions, each with different AI rules. One agency might need to comply with NYC LL144, Colorado AI Act, and client-specific AI policies simultaneously
2. **ATS/CRM AI adoption ungoverned** — Bullhorn, JobAdder, Vincere all embedding AI for candidate matching, resume parsing, outreach automation. Agencies using these features with zero governance documentation
3. **Candidate data exposure** — recruiters paste CVs, salary data, performance notes into ChatGPT for candidate summaries. No data classification, no retention policies
4. **Bias liability** — if AI screening tool has disparate impact, the staffing agency is jointly liable with the client employer. Most agencies have zero audit trail
5. **Revenue at risk** — enterprise clients increasingly requiring AI governance documentation from vendors (including staffing agencies) as part of MSA/vendor qualification

### ROI Model (40-person staffing agency)

| Value Driver | Annual Savings |
|---|---|
| Compliance labor (multi-state tracking, audit prep) | $25,000 |
| Bias audit documentation & reporting | $15,000 |
| Candidate data governance (reduce breach risk) | $10,000 |
| Enterprise client qualification (win MSAs requiring AI governance) | $30,000+ |
| **Total annual value** | **~$80,000** |
| **Implementation cost** | **$120,000** |
| **Breakeven** | **~18 months** |

The enterprise client qualification angle is the strongest — agencies losing MSA bids because they can't demonstrate AI governance is a revenue problem, not just a compliance cost.

### CRM Prospects (ranked by fit)

| Company | Employees | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tiger Recruitment | 50 | Business support staffing — likely placing in regulated industries |
| Sphere Digital Recruitment | 50 | Digital/tech recruitment — high AI usage likely |
| Brite Recruitment | 30 | General staffing |
| MRJ Recruitment | 20 | General staffing |
| 80Twenty | 10 | Boutique — may be too small for $120K engagement |

**Gap:** CRM recruitment companies are UK-based and small. US recruitment agencies 50-500 employees would be stronger ICP. Recommend Strategist sources US staffing firms for CRM.

### Key Objection Prep

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "Our ATS handles compliance" | "Your ATS embeds AI for matching and screening. Who audited those algorithms for bias? When NYC or Colorado asks for your impact assessment, Bullhorn won't provide it." |
| "We're too small for AI governance" | "NYC LL144 applies to every employer and agency using automated screening — no size threshold. $500-$1,500 per violation per day." |
| "Our clients handle their own compliance" | "EEOC guidance is clear: the staffing agency is jointly liable for disparate impact from AI screening tools. Your client won't indemnify you." |
| "We only use AI for sourcing, not decisions" | "Colorado's AI Act covers any AI that 'substantially contributes' to employment decisions. Ranking candidates by AI match score qualifies." |

## 3. Deal Pipeline Review
- 10 most recent deals all in `prospecting` stage — no movement
- All are Real Estate vertical ($42K-$66K)
- **No deals logged for**: Accounting (5 prospects identified), Law Firms (5 identified), Insurance, Banking, Dental
- **Action needed:** Deals from non-RE verticals should be created to reflect full pipeline value

## 4. Cross-Vertical Pattern: The "Joint Liability" Angle
Across every vertical researched, the same pattern emerges:
- **Real Estate:** Broker liable for agent AI outputs
- **Insurance:** Agency liable for producer AI errors
- **Banking:** Bank liable for vendor-embedded AI
- **Law Firms:** Partners liable for associate AI usage
- **Staffing:** Agency jointly liable with client for AI screening bias

This is AfrexAI's universal pitch: **"The entity at the top is always liable for ungoverned AI at the bottom."** Every vertical, same story. The governance framework is the protection layer.
