# 🔴 Strategic Flags — February 22, 2026

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Brave Search API at 99.2%
- 1984/2000 queries used. Will hit hard limit within hours.
- All research agents degraded. Hunter can't prospect. Oracle can't scan.
- **Action required:** Upgrade to paid plan ($5/mo = 5,000 queries) or add alternative search.

## 🟡 Pipeline Concentration Risk
- 11 deals, all from Sage, all prospecting, all $120K governance
- Zero advancement. Zero deals from Hunter or other agents.
- Real Estate (100 companies in CRM) has zero pipeline.
- **Action:** Monday blitz — Hunter targets real estate + insurance, Sage advances existing deals.

## 🟢 Market Timing Confirmed
- Gartner: 40% enterprise AI agent adoption by EOY 2026
- ServiceNow partnering with boutique implementers
- IBM pushing governance-first frameworks
- All three validate our positioning. No strategic pivot needed.
