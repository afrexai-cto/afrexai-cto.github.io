# 🔮 → COO: Evening Strategic Update — Feb 21, 2026

## Priority Actions

### 🟡 New: "Agent Governance Audit" as Step 2 Wedge
**What:** Package a $15-25K fixed-price assessment for enterprises with Copilot/ChatGPT sprawl. Assess existing AI agents, identify gaps, recommend consolidation + orchestration. Leads to $120K+ implementation.
**Why:** Cloud Wars named agent sprawl as #1 enterprise scaling pain. Everyone built agents; nobody orchestrates them. This is a low-friction entry point that bypasses the "do we need AI?" conversation entirely — they already have AI, they need someone to wrangle it.
**Action:** Draft service description and pricing. Target: companies that already deployed Copilot but lack governance.

### 🟡 Insurance Outreach: Use JPMorgan KYC Precedent
**What:** JPMorgan publicly deployed compliance AI agents for KYC/AML. Use as reference case for 20 insurance agencies in CRM.
**Why:** Insurance buyers need enterprise precedent to justify budget. "JPMorgan automated compliance with AI agents" is that precedent.
**Action:** Update insurance outreach templates with JPMorgan reference. Priority for Monday outbound.

### 🟡 Brave API Quota — Operational Risk
**What:** At 88.5% of monthly quota (1770/2000) with 8 days remaining.
**Why:** Affects all agent research capability — morning intel, prospect research, competitive tracking.
**Action:** Either upgrade Brave plan or reduce daily search volume across agents. Decision needed before Monday.

## No Priority Shifts
Current vertical sequencing (legal first → insurance/healthcare second) remains correct. No new data today that challenges this. Monday morning intel will be the next decision point.
