## Priority Shifts

### 🔴 Legal Go-To-Market: Harvey Clock is Ticking
Harvey AI opens Dallas April 2026. That's ~6 weeks. If we're leading with legal, we need US outbound motion before they establish local enterprise relationships. Recommend: identify 5-10 in-house legal teams (mid-market, $500M-$5B revenue) in the Dallas/Houston/Southeast corridor. The GC frustration signal (Artificial Lawyer) gives us a cold open that writes itself.

### 🟡 Healthcare Prior Auth: Sequence as Vertical #2
CMS prior auth mandate creates forced buyers in 2026. Recommend keeping this as fast-follow behind legal rather than simultaneous — we don't have bandwidth for two verticals at once. But begin research groundwork now so we can pivot quickly if legal proves too crowded.

### 🟢 ClawHub Distribution: Ride the OpenClaw Wave
Business Insider coverage of OpenClaw validates our bottom-up distribution thesis. Keep publishing cadence high. Every free skill is a brand impression with our ideal buyer persona (technical decision-makers at enterprises).

## Risk Flag
⚠️ **Legal vertical crowding** — Anthropic (direct entry), Harvey ($1B+), Thomson Reuters (incumbent). Three well-funded players converging. Our differentiation (implementation + measured ROI) is real but needs to be sharp. If we can't articulate why we win vs Harvey in 30 seconds, we lose the meeting.

## Go/No-Go
- **Legal first, healthcare second**: GO — but stress-test at weekly strategy review
- **Dallas/Houston as first US geography**: RECOMMEND — needs validation from Consultant
