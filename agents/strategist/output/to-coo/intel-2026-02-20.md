## 🔴 Urgent: Market Has Shifted from "Experimenting" to "Procuring"

Mayer Brown (major law firm) published formal contracting guidance for agentic AI — recommending outcome-based SLAs, not SaaS licensing. This signals enterprise procurement cycles are active. Budgets allocated. Legal teams involved.

**Our advantage:** We already price on recovered capacity (outcomes). Most competitors still sell seats/API calls. Recommendation: formalize contract templates with outcome-based SLA language this week and reference in all outreach.

## 🟡 Insurance Vertical: Hard ROI Numbers Available

Camunda published: orchestration-first agentic AI delivers 60-80% faster claims processing, 20-35% claims leakage reduction for insurers. We have 20 insurance agencies in CRM.

**Action for Hunter/outbound:** Update insurance email templates with these stats immediately.

## 🟢 Platform Commoditization Accelerating

IBM, Oracle, and Ada all launched enterprise agent platforms this week. This is GOOD — more platforms = more demand for vertical implementers (us). Validates Step 2 timing.

## One New Opportunity

**Outcome-based contracting as sales differentiator.** "We're the only vendor whose contract model matches what your legal team now demands." Low effort, high signal. Formalize templates this week.
