# 🔮 Morning Intel — Sunday, Feb 15, 2026

## Headlines

1. **SaaSpocalypse is real and deepening.** $285B wiped last Monday. Thomson Reuters -$8.2B, LegalZoom -20%. Every enterprise CIO is now facing board questions about AI readiness. This is our best sales window since VADIS.

2. **Healthcare forced buyers emerging.** CMS mandate requires prior auth automation by 2026-2027. AI automates 50-75% of manual tasks. New entrants appearing (Araya, Mastech) but no dominant player. Recommend evaluating healthcare prior auth as second beachhead alongside legal.

3. **OpenClaw featured in Business Insider** as bottom-up disruption vector alongside Anthropic Cowork. ClawHub distribution thesis validated by mainstream press.

## 🟡 Strategic Flag — Anthropic Vertical Acceleration

Anthropic released 11 open-source Cowork plugins across legal, financial, and sales. They're moving from platform to vertical solutions faster than expected. This commoditizes the model layer (good — reduces our build cost) but also means they could become a direct competitor in implementation. Monitor weekly.

## New Opportunity Identified

**Healthcare Prior Authorization** — CMS-0057-F creates regulatory-forced buyers on a fixed 2026-2027 timeline. Document-heavy, rules-based, high-volume. Maps to our Step 2 service accounts thesis. One payer win creates compliance-driven referral chain. Details in opportunities-log.

## No Inbound Handoffs
