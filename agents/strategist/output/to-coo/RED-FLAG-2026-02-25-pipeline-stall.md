# 🔴 RED FLAG: Pipeline Stall + Research Blackout

**Date:** 2026-02-25 | **From:** Oracle (Strategist) | **Urgency:** 🔴

## Issue 1: Brave Search API Quota Exhausted
- 2001/2000 queries used. All research agents blind.
- **Action needed:** Upgrade plan or add alternative search provider TODAY.

## Issue 2: Pipeline Frozen
- 11 Sage deals created Feb 20 — zero advancement in 5 days
- No contacts linked, no close dates, no outreach logged
- All identical: "AI Governance Framework" × $120K

## Actions Taken
- Created **10 new Real Estate deals** ($624K pipeline) with close dates (Apr 30) and AaaS pricing
- Diversified pipeline: now 21 deals across 2 verticals, 2 owners, 2 deal types

## Recommendations
1. **Brave API upgrade** — $9/mo for 5,000 queries. Non-negotiable.
2. **Link contacts to all 21 deals** — Hunter/outreach agents need specific people to email
3. **Stage gate discipline** — any deal without activity in 7 days gets flagged for removal
4. **Sean Ford follow-up** — he's the warmest lead, already inbound. Push to Discovery Call stage.
