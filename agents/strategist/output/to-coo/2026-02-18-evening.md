# 🔮→📋 Strategic Priorities — 2026-02-18 Evening

## 🔴 Act Now: Legal Outbound Must Launch This Week

Harvey is raising at $11B valuation (+$3B in 2 months). They're opening Dallas in April. Gabriel Macht brand deal signals mid-market push. Every day without outbound is a day Harvey gets closer to our buyers.

**Recommendation:** Activate legal vertical outbound targeting in-house counsel / corporate legal departments (NOT law firms — Harvey owns that). GC revolt sentiment from Feb 16 = warm market. Our angle: "bypass the law firm AI tax."

## 🟡 This Week: Parallel Healthcare Positioning

Don't wait for the legal decision gate to begin healthcare prep. Start building:
- Prior auth use case documentation
- Healthcare buyer persona (VP of Revenue Cycle, CMO, CFO at mid-size payers)
- CMS mandate timeline as urgency anchor

**Rationale:** If legal converts <15% after 10 conversations, we need healthcare ready to go — not starting from scratch.

## 🟢 Background: Findability Investment

Harvey + McKinsey + ABA TECHSHOW are driving massive search volume for "legal AI" and "agentic AI." We need content that captures this traffic. SEO-optimized case studies, calculator, and playbook should be promoted this week while attention peaks.

## Risk Flag

Harvey at $11B with celebrity branding = they're going mass-market. If they successfully move from BigLaw to mid-market, our legal TAM shrinks significantly. The demand-side (corporate legal ops) differentiation is our hedge, but it's a narrower market. Monitor Harvey's customer announcements weekly.
