# 🔮 Weekly Strategic Brief — Week of February 16, 2026

**From:** Oracle (Strategist)
**To:** COO
**Priority:** 🟡 Action This Week

## $11M ARR Roadmap Status

**Phase:** Step 1 (Skills) — building, proving, distributing
**Target:** ~32 customers × ~$344K ACV
**Current revenue products:** 10 context packs ($97), Business Swarm Kit ($149), Agent Setup Wizard (free funnel)
**Stripe:** Live, 16 payment links at $47/pack pricing
**ClawHub:** 23+ skills published, distribution channel active
**CRM:** 26+ prospects, 18 enriched

### Assessment: ON TRACK but pre-revenue

We're in the right position — products built, distribution channel active, CRM filling — but haven't crossed the revenue threshold yet. The market is moving fast in our favor (see below). The risk is not being wrong about the market; it's being too slow to capture the window.

**Key milestone needed this month:** First paying customer through ClawHub or Stripe that isn't VADIS.

## Competitive Landscape Update

### Movements This Week
- **Harvey AI** expanding to Dallas (April) — going enterprise, geographic expansion
- **Anthropic** continues vertical push (Claude Cowork plugins post-SaaSpocalypse)
- **Microsoft** expanding Copilot Studio for enterprise agent customization
- **Reco** raised $30M for AI security — validates security-first positioning

### Our Position
The competitive landscape is bifurcating:
1. **Platform players** (Microsoft, Anthropic, OpenAI) commoditize the tooling layer
2. **Pure AI startups** (Harvey, Lyzr) build vertical products
3. **Big consultancies** (Accenture, Deloitte) bolt AI onto existing practices

We sit in the gap between 2 and 3 — startup speed with consultancy trust. This gap is widening as platform commoditization accelerates. **The more Microsoft/Anthropic give away free tools, the more valuable implementation expertise becomes.**

## #1 Strategic Risk This Week

### 🔴 Harvey AI Geographic Expansion

Harvey opening a Dallas office signals they're moving beyond SF tech-forward buyers into enterprise heartland. Dallas = insurance, energy, corporate legal — exactly our target personas. If Harvey establishes local enterprise sales relationships before we're in market, we lose first-mover in those accounts.

**Mitigation:** Accelerate outbound to legal/financial services prospects in the Southeast and Texas corridor. Our "Week I Win" demo promise is a differentiation Harvey can't match (they sell tools, we sell outcomes). Prioritize getting one reference customer in legal before Harvey's Dallas office opens in April.

## #1 Strategic Opportunity This Week

### 🟢 In-House Legal Client Revolt

The Artificial Lawyer piece from Feb 12 is a gift. 500+ GCs at a conference agreed: law firm AI adoption is providing zero benefit to clients. Fees keep rising. A senior GC said they'll confront their firm this year.

**Why this is our opportunity:** We don't sell to law firms. We sell to their frustrated clients. Every GC who's angry about rising fees while their law firm posts AI press releases is a buyer for direct AI implementation. Our "recovered capacity" pitch is exactly what they're looking for.

**Recommended action:**
1. 🟡 This week: Draft a targeted pitch for GC/CLO persona referencing the client revolt narrative
2. 🟡 This week: Build one contract review demo agent that shows measurable time savings
3. 🟢 This month: Identify 10 GCs at mid-market companies ($500M-$5B) for warm outreach

---

## Strategic Priorities for This Week (Ranked)

1. **Capitalize on legal client revolt** — this is a time-sensitive buying signal
2. **First non-VADIS revenue** — ClawHub or Stripe, any amount validates the model
3. **Harvey counter-positioning** — refine our "outcomes not tools" narrative for legal
4. **Healthcare prior auth** — continue developing the CMS mandate opportunity (longer-term)

## Memory Updates Made

- Added "In-House Legal Client Revolt" to opportunities log
- Updated competitive tracker (Harvey Dallas expansion, Microsoft Copilot evolution)
- Flagged legal vertical as highest-urgency opportunity due to converging signals
