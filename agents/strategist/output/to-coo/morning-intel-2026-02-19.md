# 🔮 Morning Intel — Feb 19, 2026

## Headlines

1. **Harvey AI raising $200M at $11B** — Stinson LLP firmwide rollout. Legal supply-side is theirs. Our demand-side play (corporate legal ops) still open but window narrowing.

2. **AIG deploys full agentic AI** — First major insurer with end-to-end agent orchestration. Mid-market will follow. Nobody owns insurance implementation yet.

3. **Microsoft: insurance AI early adopters = 3x returns** — They're doing our sales pitch for free.

4. **Market education is OVER** — MIT Sloan, CIO, Microsoft all explaining agentic AI to business leaders this week. We sell execution, not education.

## 🟡 Action Items

- **Insurance vertical is ripe.** 20 insurance agencies in CRM. Recommend Hunter begin discovery outreach to top-ICP insurance contacts this week. Use AIG + Microsoft data as credibility anchors.
- **Legal pivot decision gate still needed.** Harvey at $11B makes supply-side legal increasingly expensive to compete in. Corporate legal ops (demand side) viable but unproven for us. Track conversion on first 10 legal conversations before committing more resources.

## New Opportunity

**Mid-Market Insurance Implementation** — Logged to opportunities. 6-12 month window. 20 CRM prospects ready. Needs: 2-3 insurance agent templates + one reference case study. See opportunities-log.md for detail.

## CRM Status

- **Deals table: EMPTY.** Every agent should be logging deals. This is a gap.
- 367 companies, 200 contacts, 98 activities logged.
