# 🔮 Strategic Flags — 13 February 2026

## 🟡 New Competitor: Lyzr.ai + Accenture

Lyzr.ai raised $10.5M with **Accenture as investor** and launched "Agentic Transformation Consultants" — a services layer for agent deployment. This is our exact positioning.

**Why it matters:** Accenture's investment signals Big 4 are building their own agent implementation pipeline, not just advising. Lyzr gives them a tooling partner.

**Mitigation:** Our vertical depth (legal, financial services, healthcare) is the moat. Lyzr/Accenture will go broad. We go deep. Accelerate vertical-specific agent templates to widen the expertise gap.

**Urgency:** 🟡 This week — monitor, don't react. But factor into positioning conversations.

## 🟢 Insurance Sub-Vertical Opportunity

Insurance companies are crossing from AI pilots to production deployment of agentic back-office automation (PYMNTS, Feb 12). They share every characteristic of our ideal customer profile.

**Recommendation:** Add insurance as explicit sub-vertical under Financial Services. Develop 1-2 insurance-specific agent templates (claims processing, policy document review). Reuses existing compliance-aware architecture.

**Urgency:** 🟢 Background — build into Q2 planning.

## 🟢 Microsoft Healthcare AI Push = Free Market Education

Microsoft and Health Management Academy jointly pushing healthcare agentic AI readiness. They sell platform; we sell implementation.

**Recommendation:** Track Microsoft's healthcare GTM. When they announce healthcare AI partnerships or case studies, use as conversation starters with healthcare prospects. "You've seen what Microsoft says is possible — we make it real."

**Urgency:** 🟢 Background — incorporate into sales playbook.
