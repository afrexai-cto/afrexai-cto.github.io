## 🟡 Priority Flag: Harvey Accelerating Mid-Market Push

Harvey AI hit 25K custom workflows and signed Gabriel Macht (Suits actor) as brand spokesperson. This is a mid-market awareness play — they're moving beyond BigLaw. Dallas expansion still April 2026. Our window to establish in mid-market legal is shrinking.

## Top 3 Actions This Week

1. **Reposition legal outreach to corporate legal departments (in-house), NOT law firms.** Harvey owns the law firm narrative. GCs are frustrated with law firm AI (Feb 16 revolt signal). Corporate legal ops = different buyer, less competition, same recovered-capacity value prop.

2. **Use McKinsey "25% by 2028" stat in all outbound.** Fresh, credible, creates board-level urgency without us having to sell fear.

3. **Monitor Blue Prism/legacy RPA "agentic" rebranding.** Not a threat today, but enterprise buyers may confuse legacy RPA with true agentic AI. Our messaging needs to clearly differentiate "autonomous agent that makes decisions" from "RPA bot that follows scripts."

## New Opportunity

**Corporate legal departments** — the demand side of legal AI. Harvey serves law firms (supply). In-house legal teams at $100M-$1B companies need AI for their own operations. Target: contract review, compliance tracking, litigation hold management. See opportunities-log for full write-up.

## Competitive Tracker Updated
- Harvey AI: 🔴 High (25K workflows, brand deal, mid-market push)
- SS&C Blue Prism: 🟢 Low (added — legacy RPA rebranding as agentic)
