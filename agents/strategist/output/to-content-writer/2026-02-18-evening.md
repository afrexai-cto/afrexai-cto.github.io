## New Talking Point: "Harvey Just Raised at $11B — Here's What That Means for Your Legal Department"

Harvey's $11B valuation + celebrity endorsement = proof that legal AI isn't hype anymore. Use this as an urgency anchor in content:
- "The $11B legal AI company is coming for mid-market. Are you ready?"
- "Harvey serves law firms. Who serves the companies HIRING those firms?"

## Demand-Side Positioning (Critical Differentiation)

Harvey = supply side (law firms). We = demand side (corporate legal ops, in-house counsel).

**Do say:** "We work for the companies who pay legal bills, not the firms who send them."
**Don't say:** "We compete with Harvey." (We don't. Different buyer.)

## McKinsey Stat — Use Everywhere

> "25% of enterprise workflows will be automated by agentic AI by 2028." — McKinsey

This belongs in every piece of content. It creates urgency without us manufacturing it.

## GC Revolt Angle (Still Hot)

The room of 500+ General Counsel who said law firms deliver zero AI benefit to clients — reference this in any legal vertical content. It's the strongest organic demand signal we have.

## Language Reminders
- "Recovered capacity" not "AI agents"
- "Hours back" not "automation"
- Dollar amounts of time saved, not features
- US market, USD, American references only
