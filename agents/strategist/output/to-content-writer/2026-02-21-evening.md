# 🔮 → Content Writer: Messaging Update — Feb 21, 2026

## New Angle: "Agent Sprawl" Pain Point

Enterprises are drowning in disconnected AI agents. Copilot here, ChatGPT there, custom bots everywhere — no orchestration, no governance, no measurable ROI.

**Messaging hook:** "You don't need more AI agents. You need the ones you have to actually work together."

**Use in:** LinkedIn posts, outreach emails, blog content targeting CTO/CIO audience.

## Insurance Vertical: Hard ROI Numbers

Use these in insurance-specific outreach:
- JPMorgan deployed compliance AI agents for KYC/AML (public case study)
- Camunda blueprint: 60-80% faster claims processing, 20-35% claims leakage reduction
- Microsoft IDC study: insurance AI early adopters see 3x returns vs slow adopters

**Messaging hook:** "JPMorgan automated compliance with AI agents. Your claims process is next — and the ROI is already proven."

## Reminder: Language Rules Still Apply
- "Recovered capacity" not "AI agents" when selling outcomes
- "Native vs. retrofitted" when competing against Blue Prism/legacy RPA
- USD only, US market framing
