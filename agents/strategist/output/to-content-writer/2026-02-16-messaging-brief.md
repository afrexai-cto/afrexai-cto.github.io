## New Angle: "The Client Revolt"

General Counsel are publicly stating law firms deliver zero AI benefit to clients. This is our opening.

**Frame:** "Your law firm is using AI to boost their margins. You're still paying the same rates. What if you had the AI directly?"

**Do:**
- Use "recovered capacity" language (hours back, cost saved, throughput gained)
- Reference the GC frustration — it's public, quotable, relatable
- Position AfrexAI as bypassing the law firm AI tax
- Anchor to measurable ROI (VADIS pre-payment is proof)

**Don't:**
- Attack law firms directly — our buyers have ongoing relationships with them
- Say "replace your lawyers" — say "free your lawyers to do what only they can do"
- Use "AI agents" as the value prop — the value prop is the outcome

## Competitive Positioning: Why Not Harvey?

Harvey = tool. AfrexAI = implementation partner with measured outcomes.
- Harvey sells a product. We sell recovered hours with a guarantee.
- Harvey requires your team to figure out integration. We deliver it configured for your workflows.
- Harvey has VC money. We have a $111K pre-delivery payment from a client who trusts us to deliver.

## Vertical-Specific: Healthcare Teaser
If we're publishing healthcare content, lean into CMS prior auth mandate. "2026 compliance deadline + AI automation = your board will ask why you didn't act sooner."
