# 🔮 Oracle — Strategic Memory

## The Target

- **$11M ARR** — This is the number. Everything flows from this.
- Requires ~**32 customers** at ~**$344K ACV** average
- Timeline: 12-18 months from launch

## The 3-Step Plan

1. **Skills** — Build and prove AI agent capabilities (current phase)
2. **Service Accounts** — Package skills into managed service offerings for enterprises
3. **AaaS (Agents-as-a-Service)** — Platform play. Recurring revenue. The real business.

Each step builds the moat for the next.

## Top Verticals

1. **Financial Services** — High compliance burden, massive document processing, willingness to pay for automation. Regulated = sticky.
2. **Legal** — Document review, contract analysis, due diligence. Time = money here more than anywhere.
3. **Healthcare** — Administrative burden is crushing. Regulatory complexity creates barriers to entry for competitors.

### Why These Three

All share: high cost of human labor, heavy regulatory overhead, document-intensive workflows, and willingness to pay premium for reliability. The compliance moat protects us once we're in.

## Competitive Landscape

- Big consultancies (Accenture, Deloitte) — slow, expensive, not AI-native
- Pure AI startups — fast but lack enterprise trust and delivery capability
- Hyperscalers (Azure AI, AWS) — platform tools, not solutions. Customers still need someone to implement.
- **Our edge:** We sit between consultancy trust and startup speed. African talent arbitrage gives margin advantage.

## Pricing Model

- ~32 customers × ~$344K ACV = $11M ARR
- Value-based pricing anchored to **recovered capacity** (FTE equivalents saved)
- NOT selling "AI agents" — selling hours back, risk reduced, throughput increased

## Key Strategic Insight

> **"Sell recovered capacity, not AI agents."**

Customers don't buy technology. They buy outcomes. Frame everything as: "We give you back X hours/week of senior staff time" or "We reduce your processing time from Y days to Z hours." The AI is the how, not the what.

## US Market Entry

- **Delaware LLC** — Standard structure for UK company entering US
- **SOC 2 Type II** — Non-negotiable for enterprise sales in financial services and healthcare
- Target: East Coast initially (NYC financial services, Boston healthcare)
- Need US-based sales presence within 6 months of first US customer

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-13)

- **Lyzr.ai** raised $10.5M with Accenture as investor, created "Agentic Transformation Consultants" — direct competitor signal. Generalist approach is their weakness vs. our vertical focus.
- **Insurance** emerging as strong sub-vertical under Financial Services. Giants deploying agentic AI in back offices (PYMNTS, Feb 12). Same buyer profile as banking.
- **Microsoft** actively pushing healthcare agentic AI readiness — doing our market education for free. Position as implementation layer on top of Azure.
- **AI funding** remains massive ($55B+ Jan 2026). Investors want revenue traction, not prototypes. Our VADIS pre-payment is strong signal.
- **Thomson Reuters 2026 Report**: 40% org-wide AI adoption in professional services, only 18% track ROI. Our "recovered capacity" framing directly solves this gap.

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-14)

- **AI Scare Trade (Feb 14):** Anthropic legal AI plug-in triggered market-wide selloff. S&P Software lost ~$2T from peak. Brokerages, legal services, data analytics all hit. This creates URGENCY for our buyers — fear of disruption = budget allocation for AI transformation.
- **Anthropic entering legal vertical directly** — elevated to 🔴 High threat on competitive tracker. Monitor weekly. Our moat remains implementation + domain expertise, not the model.
- **Agentic AI vs RPA narrative now mainstream** — industry validating that agents automate decisions, not just tasks. Supports "recovered capacity" pricing.
- **Riff white paper** validates our Step 1→2 thesis: domain expertise encoded into working software is the unlock.

## Open Strategic Questions

- When do we move from Step 1 (Skills) to Step 2 (Service Accounts)?
- Which vertical do we lead with for US entry?
- Partnership vs direct sales for initial US traction?
- How do we price the transition from project-based to AaaS?

## TARGET MARKET
- **US ONLY** — AfrexAI is a US-based company
- Focus on US competitive landscape and US market opportunities
- Currency: USD ($)
