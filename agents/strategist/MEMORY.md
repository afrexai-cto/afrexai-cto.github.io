# 🔮 Oracle — Strategic Memory

## The Target

- **$11M ARR** — This is the number. Everything flows from this.
- Requires ~**32 customers** at ~**$344K ACV** average
- Timeline: 12-18 months from launch

## The 3-Step Plan

1. **Skills** — Build and prove AI agent capabilities (current phase)
2. **Service Accounts** — Package skills into managed service offerings for enterprises
3. **AaaS (Agents-as-a-Service)** — Platform play. Recurring revenue. The real business.

Each step builds the moat for the next.

## Top Verticals

1. **Financial Services** — High compliance burden, massive document processing, willingness to pay for automation. Regulated = sticky.
2. **Legal** — Document review, contract analysis, due diligence. Time = money here more than anywhere.
3. **Healthcare** — Administrative burden is crushing. Regulatory complexity creates barriers to entry for competitors.

### Why These Three

All share: high cost of human labor, heavy regulatory overhead, document-intensive workflows, and willingness to pay premium for reliability. The compliance moat protects us once we're in.

## Competitive Landscape

- Big consultancies (Accenture, Deloitte) — slow, expensive, not AI-native
- Pure AI startups — fast but lack enterprise trust and delivery capability
- Hyperscalers (Azure AI, AWS) — platform tools, not solutions. Customers still need someone to implement.
- **Our edge:** We sit between consultancy trust and startup speed. African talent arbitrage gives margin advantage.

## Pricing Model

- ~32 customers × ~$344K ACV = $11M ARR
- Value-based pricing anchored to **recovered capacity** (FTE equivalents saved)
- NOT selling "AI agents" — selling hours back, risk reduced, throughput increased

## Key Strategic Insight

> **"Sell recovered capacity, not AI agents."**

Customers don't buy technology. They buy outcomes. Frame everything as: "We give you back X hours/week of senior staff time" or "We reduce your processing time from Y days to Z hours." The AI is the how, not the what.

## US Market Entry

- **Delaware LLC** — Standard structure for UK company entering US
- **SOC 2 Type II** — Non-negotiable for enterprise sales in financial services and healthcare
- Target: East Coast initially (NYC financial services, Boston healthcare)
- Need US-based sales presence within 6 months of first US customer

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-13)

- **Lyzr.ai** raised $10.5M with Accenture as investor, created "Agentic Transformation Consultants" — direct competitor signal. Generalist approach is their weakness vs. our vertical focus.
- **Insurance** emerging as strong sub-vertical under Financial Services. Giants deploying agentic AI in back offices (PYMNTS, Feb 12). Same buyer profile as banking.
- **Microsoft** actively pushing healthcare agentic AI readiness — doing our market education for free. Position as implementation layer on top of Azure.
- **AI funding** remains massive ($55B+ Jan 2026). Investors want revenue traction, not prototypes. Our VADIS pre-payment is strong signal.
- **Thomson Reuters 2026 Report**: 40% org-wide AI adoption in professional services, only 18% track ROI. Our "recovered capacity" framing directly solves this gap.

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-14)

- **AI Scare Trade (Feb 14):** Anthropic legal AI plug-in triggered market-wide selloff. S&P Software lost ~$2T from peak. Brokerages, legal services, data analytics all hit. This creates URGENCY for our buyers — fear of disruption = budget allocation for AI transformation.
- **Anthropic entering legal vertical directly** — elevated to 🔴 High threat on competitive tracker. Monitor weekly. Our moat remains implementation + domain expertise, not the model.
- **Agentic AI vs RPA narrative now mainstream** — industry validating that agents automate decisions, not just tasks. Supports "recovered capacity" pricing.
- **Riff white paper** validates our Step 1→2 thesis: domain expertise encoded into working software is the unlock.

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-16)

- **GC Client Revolt:** General Counsel publicly stating law firms deliver zero AI benefit to clients despite internal adoption. Room of 500+ GCs agreed. This is the strongest organic demand signal for our legal vertical — buyers are frustrated and looking for alternatives. "Bypass the law firm AI tax" is our messaging wedge.
- **Harvey AI Dallas expansion (April 2026):** 6-week clock. They're moving from SF into enterprise territory. Dallas/Houston corridor = legal + insurance + energy. We must be in market before they establish local presence.
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio enterprise push:** Accelerates commoditization of agent platform layer. Validates our Step 2 timing — platform is free, implementation is the product.
- **Healthcare prior auth + legal revolt = two forced-buyer markets in 2026.** Sequence: legal first (VADIS proof), healthcare second (CMS mandate pressure Q3-Q4).
- **Contrarian flag logged:** Legal may be too crowded (Harvey, Anthropic, Thomson Reuters). Healthcare prior auth has fewer competitors + regulatory forcing function. Decision gate: track conversion rate from first 10 legal conversations.

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-18)

- **Harvey AI at 25K workflows + celebrity brand deal** (Gabriel Macht from Suits). Clear mid-market push beyond BigLaw. Dallas expansion April 2026 still on track. Threat level remains 🔴 High.
- **McKinsey stat: 25% enterprise workflows automated by agentic AI by 2028.** Use in every sales conversation as urgency anchor.
- **Legacy RPA (Blue Prism) rebranding as "agentic"** — reduces our education burden but increases noise. Vertical specificity is our differentiation.
- **New opportunity identified: Corporate legal departments (in-house)** as distinct from law firms. Harvey serves supply side (firms), we can own demand side (corporate legal ops). GC revolt + Harvey's market education = warm buyers looking for alternatives.

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-19)

- **Harvey AI raising $200M at $11B valuation** (up from $8B Dec 2025). Stinson LLP rolled out firmwide. Supply-side dominance accelerating. Demand-side (corporate legal ops) remains our lane.
- **AIG deployed full agentic AI orchestration** — front-to-back workflow (intake, risk, claims). First major insurer to go public with full agent deployment. Mid-market insurers will follow.
- **Microsoft IDC study: insurance AI early adopters see 3x returns** vs slow adopters. Microsoft actively evangelizing agentic AI for insurance. Free market education.
- **MIT Sloan published "Agentic AI Explained"** — market education phase is over. Enterprise buyers understand the category. Question is now WHO implements, not WHAT it is.
- **New opportunity logged: mid-market insurance implementation.** Nobody owns this space yet. 20 insurance agencies already in CRM. 6-12 month window before Big 4 package offerings.

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-20)

- **Mayer Brown published agentic AI contracting guidance** — formal shift from SaaS to services model. Recommends outcome-based SLAs, BPO-style clauses, indemnification, governance/audit rights. Enterprise legal teams now EXPECTING this contract structure. Our "recovered capacity" pricing already aligns. Use in every pitch.
- **Camunda insurance blueprint: 60-80% faster claims, 20-35% claims leakage reduction** with orchestration-first agentic AI. Hard ROI numbers for insurance outreach. 20 insurance agencies in CRM.
- **Platform acceleration:** IBM Watson Orchestrate ADK, Oracle Fusion AI Agent Studio, Ada Reasoning Engine all launched same week. Platform commoditization accelerating — validates our implementation-layer positioning.
- **Contracting shift = procurement activation.** Law firms writing contract guidance means budgets are being allocated, legal/procurement teams involved, enterprise buying cycle has begun. Market crossed from "experimenting" to "procuring."
- **New opportunity logged:** Outcome-based contracting as structural sales differentiator. Formalize contract templates with outcome-based SLA language.

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-21)

- **Agent sprawl is now a named enterprise pain point.** Cloud Wars identifies orchestration + governance as the #1 scaling challenge. Building agents is commoditized; managing them is the new differentiator. Validates our Step 2 implementation positioning.
- **Agentic AI market: $7.38B → $47B by 2030** (44.8% CAGR, MarketsandMarkets). JPMorgan deployed compliance AI agents for KYC/AML. Mid-tier firms (Kanerika) getting visibility — market fragmenting, room for vertical specialists.
- **Blue Prism continuing hard pivot** from RPA to "AI agent integration." Enterprise relationships but weak AI-native capability. Watch for them targeting insurance/fintech with existing accounts.
- **New opportunity logged:** "Agent Governance Audit" as Step 2 wedge — $15K-$25K fixed-price assessment leading to $120K+ implementation. Target: enterprises with Copilot/ChatGPT sprawl.
- **Brave Search API at 88.5% quota** (1770/2000). Will hit limit before month-end at current pace. Flag for upgrade or alternative.

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-21 Evening)

- **"Agent Governance Audit" identified as Step 2 wedge** — $15-25K assessment → $120K implementation. But contrarian flag raised: this looks like consulting, not product. Must convert to orchestration layer deployment, not just reports.
- **JPMorgan KYC/AML deployment** is the reference case for insurance outreach. 20 agencies in CRM ready for Monday.
- **Brave API at 88.5% quota** — operational constraint affecting all agents. Upgrade or throttle decision needed.

## Key Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-22)

- **Gartner: 40% enterprise apps will embed AI agents by EOY 2026** (up from <5% in 2025). Market adoption inflection confirmed. Use in every outreach.
- **FourDragons (boutique firm) landed ServiceNow partnership** for AI Agent deployment. Pattern: platform vendors need implementation partners. Partnership play logged as new opportunity.
- **IBM 2026 AI Trends: governance from day one** — agent sprawl named #1 scaling challenge again. Our governance audit wedge is market-timed.
- **Pipeline state: 11 deals, all prospecting, all Sage, all $120K.** Zero advancement. Concentration risk flagged. Real Estate (100 companies) has zero pipeline.
- **⚠️ Brave API at 99.2% (1984/2000).** Critical — all research agents degraded. Upgrade decision needed Monday.
- **New opportunity: Platform Partnership Play** — pursue formal implementation partnership with ServiceNow or Microsoft for warm leads + credibility.

## Open Strategic Questions

- When do we move from Step 1 (Skills) to Step 2 (Service Accounts)?
- Which vertical do we lead with for US entry? (Legal is consensus, but healthcare contrarian case is strong)
- Partnership vs direct sales for initial US traction?
- How do we price the transition from project-based to AaaS?
- Should we target Dallas/Houston as first US geography given Harvey's move there?
- Decision gate: If legal outbound converts <15% after 10 conversations, pivot healthcare to lead?
- Is our demand-side legal differentiation structural or merely temporal? (Contrarian flag 2026-02-18)
- First 5 legal discovery calls should probe Harvey evaluation experience specifically
- Is "Agent Governance Audit" a product wedge or a consulting trap? Track audit → implementation conversion. (Contrarian flag 2026-02-21)
- Should we build an orchestration PRODUCT (prevents sprawl) vs. an audit SERVICE (cleans up sprawl)?
