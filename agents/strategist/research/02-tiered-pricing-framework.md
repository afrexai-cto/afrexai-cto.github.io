### Tier Structure

#### 🟢 Starter — £1,500/month
**"Get Your First AI Win"**

**What's included:**
- 1 AI workflow audit (2-3 hour deep-dive into operations)
- 1 custom AI automation built and deployed
- Workflow monitoring and basic maintenance
- Monthly performance review (30-min call)
- Slack/email support (48-hour response)

**Ideal for:** Companies new to AI, want to test with low commitment
**Contract:** 3-month minimum, then month-to-month
**Pilot entry:** £2,000 one-time for 4-week pilot → converts to Starter

**Positioning psychology:**

#### 🔵 Growth — £2,500/month ⭐ MOST POPULAR
**"Your AI Operations Partner"**

- Quarterly roadmap reviews with priority recommendations
- Bi-weekly check-ins (30-min calls)
- Priority Slack/email support (24-hour response)
- Access to AfrexAI's automation playbook library

**Ideal for:** Scaling companies with multiple manual workflows
**Contract:** 6-month minimum, then month-to-month
**Upsell triggers:** When they max out 3 automations, need faster response, or want integrations

**Positioning psychology:**
- The "⭐ MOST POPULAR" label is critical — social proof drives selection.
- 3 automations vs. 1 makes the £1,000 premium feel like a bargain.
- Bi-weekly calls build relationship → higher retention.

#### 🟣 Scale — £5,000/month
**"AI-First Operations"**

**What's included:**
- Everything in Growth, plus:
- Unlimited AI automations (fair use: ~5-8 active)
- Dedicated account manager
- Weekly strategy calls
- Same-day support response
- Custom integrations with existing tech stack
- Quarterly executive briefing on AI opportunities
- Priority access to new AfrexAI capabilities

**Ideal for:** Companies going all-in on AI automation across departments
**Contract:** 12-month commitment (annual discount: pay 10 months, get 12)
**Upsell from Growth:** "You're already running 3 automations — at Scale, we can automate your entire ops layer."

**Positioning psychology:**
- Exists partly to make Growth look reasonable (price anchoring).
- "Unlimited" triggers loss aversion — "what if I need more?"
- Annual commitment at 17% discount incentivises long-term lock-in.

### Pricing Psychology Principles (UK-Specific)

#### 1. The Decoy Effect
Starter exists partly to make Growth the obvious choice. The jump from £1,500 to £2,500
for 3x the automations + bi-weekly calls is designed to feel like a no-brainer.

#### 2. Anchoring
Always present Scale first in conversations. "Our full partnership is £5,000/month.
Most clients start at Growth for £2,500." The £5K anchor makes £2.5K feel moderate.

#### 3. UK Price Sensitivity
- UK mid-market buyers expect value justification more than US buyers
- Always frame price against cost of the problem: "You're spending £4,000/month in salary
  on this process. We automate it for £2,500."
- GBP pricing only — never show USD, it signals "American company"

#### 4. Loss Aversion in Contracts
- Starter: 3-month minimum → low commitment, easy to say yes
- Growth: 6-month minimum → reasonable, matches budget cycles
- Scale: 12-month → offset with annual discount (2 months free)
- Always offer month-to-month after minimums — retention through value, not lock-in

#### 5. The Pilot Bridge
The £2,000 pilot is the most important pricing element:
- Reduces "£0 to £1,500/mo" decision to "£2,000 one-time" decision
- 4 weeks gives enough time to demonstrate real ROI
- Pilot fee applies as credit to first month if they convert
- Pilot conversion target: >70%

### Discount Policy
- **Never discount the monthly rate.** It sets precedent and devalues the service.
- **Acceptable concessions:**
  - Waive pilot fee for high-value prospects
  - Offer 13th month free on annual Scale commitment
  - Reduce Starter minimum to 2 months for warm referrals
  - Add an extra automation to Growth for strategic accounts
- **Volume discount:** 2+ departments = 15% off total, position as "enterprise rate"

### Revenue Expansion Playbook
| Trigger | Expansion Path | Revenue Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Maxed out Starter automation | Upgrade to Growth | +£1,000/mo |
| Growth client requests integrations | Upgrade to Scale | +£2,500/mo |
| New department wants AI | Add second contract | +£1,500-5,000/mo |
| Client refers another company | New Starter client | +£1,500/mo |
| Annual renewal | Propose Scale with discount | +£2,500/mo |

### Pricing Page Design (Website)
- Show all 3 tiers side-by-side, Growth highlighted
- Include "Starting at" language for SEO
- Feature the pilot prominently: "Not sure? Start with a 4-week pilot for £2,000"
- Add testimonial under each tier from a client at that level
- Calculator: "How much is manual work costing you?" → reveals pricing after engagement
