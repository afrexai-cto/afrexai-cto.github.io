## 2026-02-16: Are We Leading With the Wrong Vertical?

**Consensus position:** Legal is our lead vertical. We have VADIS as proof, legal AI is hot, GC frustration creates demand.

**Contrarian case:** Legal AI is becoming the most crowded AI vertical in 2026. Harvey ($1B+), Anthropic (direct entry), Thomson Reuters (incumbent), dozens of startups. Every AI company sees the same GC frustration data we do. By the time we're in market, legal AI may be a Red Ocean.

Healthcare prior auth, by contrast, has: (a) a regulatory forcing function (CMS 2026-2027 mandate), (b) fewer AI-native competitors, (c) larger total addressable market, (d) stickier relationships once embedded in payer workflows. The compliance moat in healthcare is DEEPER than in legal.

**What would change my mind:** If our first 3 legal conversations convert at >30% to paid engagement, legal crowding doesn't matter — execution beats market structure. But if conversion is <15%, we should seriously consider pivoting healthcare to lead.

**Action:** Track legal conversion rate from first outbound. Set decision gate at 10 conversations.

## 2026-02-18: What If the "Demand Side" Play Is a Cope?

**Consensus position:** We differentiate by serving corporate legal ops (demand side) while Harvey serves law firms (supply side). Different buyer, different sale.

**Contrarian case:** Corporate legal departments are smaller budgets than law firms. A $344K ACV sale to an in-house legal team means we need their ENTIRE AI budget. Law firms have 10-100x the revenue and tech spend. Harvey at $11B valuation with celebrity branding means they'll ALSO come for in-house counsel eventually — they're not going to leave that market alone. Our "demand side" differentiation may only buy us 6-12 months before Harvey expands there too.

**The real question:** Is our legal differentiation structural or temporal? If it's just a timing advantage, we need to convert fast and build switching costs before Harvey arrives. If it's structural (we genuinely solve different problems for the buyer), we have a durable moat.

**What would change my mind:** If corporate legal ops buyers confirm in discovery calls that their needs are fundamentally different from what Harvey offers (not just "Harvey is too expensive" but "Harvey doesn't solve THIS problem"). That would validate structural differentiation.

**Action:** First 5 legal discovery calls should specifically probe: "Have you evaluated Harvey? What did/didn't it solve for you?"
