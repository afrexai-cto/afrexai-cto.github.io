## 2026-02-16: Are We Leading With the Wrong Vertical?

**Consensus position:** Legal is our lead vertical. We have VADIS as proof, legal AI is hot, GC frustration creates demand.

**Contrarian case:** Legal AI is becoming the most crowded AI vertical in 2026. Harvey ($1B+), Anthropic (direct entry), Thomson Reuters (incumbent), dozens of startups. Every AI company sees the same GC frustration data we do. By the time we're in market, legal AI may be a Red Ocean.

Healthcare prior auth, by contrast, has: (a) a regulatory forcing function (CMS 2026-2027 mandate), (b) fewer AI-native competitors, (c) larger total addressable market, (d) stickier relationships once embedded in payer workflows. The compliance moat in healthcare is DEEPER than in legal.

**What would change my mind:** If our first 3 legal conversations convert at >30% to paid engagement, legal crowding doesn't matter — execution beats market structure. But if conversion is <15%, we should seriously consider pivoting healthcare to lead.

**Action:** Track legal conversion rate from first outbound. Set decision gate at 10 conversations.
