# 🔮 Daily Intel — Saturday, February 21, 2026

## Top Findings

### 1. Enterprise AI Scaling Is the New Differentiator (Cloud Wars)
Building agents is commoditized. The battle has shifted to **scaling, orchestrating, and governing** them. Cloud Wars (Feb 21) identifies six capabilities enterprises need: autonomy, orchestration, accountability, model flexibility, guardrails, and MCP-based governance. **AI Agent & Copilot Summit** (March 17-19, San Diego) signals Microsoft ecosystem consolidation.

**Implication for AfrexAI:** This validates our Step 2 positioning perfectly. Everyone can build agents now — the value is in orchestrating them within enterprise workflows with proper governance. Our "recovered capacity" framing + vertical domain expertise = the implementation layer that platforms can't provide. Consider attending or monitoring the Copilot Summit for partnership signals.

### 2. Agentic AI Market: $7.38B → $47B by 2030 (44.8% CAGR)
MarketsandMarkets projects explosive growth. JPMorgan Chase deployed compliance AI agents for KYC/AML automation — reducing manual workloads significantly. Kanerika, a mid-tier consulting firm, positioned among "top 8 agentic AI companies" alongside OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic.

**Implication for AfrexAI:** JPMorgan KYC/AML use case is directly relevant to our financial services vertical. The fact that mid-tier firms like Kanerika are getting visibility as "agentic AI companies" means the market is fragmenting — there's room for vertical specialists. Our 20 insurance agencies + fintech/banking contacts should hear about JPMorgan's precedent.

### 3. Blue Prism Pivoting Hard Into "AI Agent Integration"
Blue Prism (legacy RPA) published enterprise integration guide for AI agents — APIs, middleware, CRM/ERP connectivity. Clear signal that legacy automation vendors are rebranding as agentic. They have existing enterprise relationships but lack AI-native architecture.

**Implication for AfrexAI:** Legacy RPA firms entering our space with enterprise trust but inferior tech. Watch for Blue Prism/SS&C targeting insurance and financial services. Our advantage: purpose-built agents vs. bolted-on AI. Use this in competitive positioning — "native vs. retrofitted."

### 4. Agent Sprawl Emerging as Enterprise Pain Point
Cloud Wars explicitly warns about "agent sprawl" — organizations creating disconnected agents without orchestration strategy. This is creating a new category of consulting: **agent governance and orchestration.**

**Implication for AfrexAI:** This could be a wedge offering: "Agent Audit" — assess a company's existing AI agents, identify gaps, consolidate, and orchestrate. Low-friction entry point that leads to full implementation deals. Worth exploring as a Step 2 accelerator.

### 5. Saturday Intel Gap
Rate-limited on additional searches (Brave Free plan, 1770/2000 quota used). Could not pull fresh Harvey AI, healthcare, or insurance-specific news today. Recommend upgrading Brave plan or supplementing with alternative search.

## Competitive Tracker Update
No new moves detected today due to search limitations. Harvey AI $200M raise at $11B (from Feb 19) remains the latest major competitive event. Blue Prism rebranding to agentic continues — threat level remains 🟡 Medium (enterprise relationships but weak AI-native capability).

## Severity
- 🟢 All findings are background intelligence — no urgent action required today
- 🟡 Brave API quota at 88.5% — will hit limit before month-end if pace continues
