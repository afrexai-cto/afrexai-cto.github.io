# 🔮 Daily Intel — Saturday, February 21, 2026

## Top Findings

### 1. Enterprise AI Scaling Is the New Differentiator (Cloud Wars)
Building agents is commoditized. The battle has shifted to **scaling, orchestrating, and governing** them. Cloud Wars (Feb 21) identifies six capabilities enterprises need: autonomy, orchestration, accountability, model flexibility, guardrails, and MCP-based governance. **AI Agent & Copilot Summit** (March 17-19, San Diego) signals Microsoft ecosystem consolidation.

**Implication for AfrexAI:** This validates our Step 2 positioning perfectly. Everyone can build agents now — the value is in orchestrating them within enterprise workflows with proper governance. Our "recovered capacity" framing + vertical domain expertise = the implementation layer that platforms can't provide. Consider attending or monitoring the Copilot Summit for partnership signals.

### 2. Agentic AI Market: $7.38B → $47B by 2030 (44.8% CAGR)
MarketsandMarkets projects explosive growth. JPMorgan Chase deployed compliance AI agents for KYC/AML automation — reducing manual workloads significantly. Kanerika, a mid-tier consulting firm, positioned among "top 8 agentic AI companies" alongside OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic.

**Implication for AfrexAI:** JPMorgan KYC/AML use case is directly relevant to our financial services vertical. The fact that mid-tier firms like Kanerika are getting visibility as "agentic AI companies" means the market is fragmenting — there's room for vertical specialists. Our 20 insurance agencies + fintech/banking contacts should hear about JPMorgan's precedent.

### 3. Blue Prism Pivoting Hard Into "AI Agent Integration"
Blue Prism (legacy RPA) published enterprise integration guide for AI agents — APIs, middleware, CRM/ERP connectivity. Clear signal that legacy automation vendors are rebranding as agentic. They have existing enterprise relationships but lack AI-native architecture.

**Implication for AfrexAI:** Legacy RPA firms entering our space with enterprise trust but inferior tech. Watch for Blue Prism/SS&C targeting insurance and financial services. Our advantage: purpose-built agents vs. bolted-on AI. Use this in competitive positioning — "native vs. retrofitted."

### 4. Agent Sprawl Emerging as Enterprise Pain Point
Cloud Wars explicitly warns about "agent sprawl" — organizations creating disconnected agents without orchestration strategy. This is creating a new category of consulting: **agent governance and orchestration.**

**Implication for AfrexAI:** This could be a wedge offering: "Agent Audit" — assess a company's existing AI agents, identify gaps, consolidate, and orchestrate. Low-friction entry point that leads to full implementation deals. Worth exploring as a Step 2 accelerator.

### 5. Saturday Intel Gap
Rate-limited on additional searches (Brave Free plan, 1770/2000 quota used). Could not pull fresh Harvey AI, healthcare, or insurance-specific news today. Recommend upgrading Brave plan or supplementing with alternative search.

## Competitive Tracker Update
No new moves detected today due to search limitations. Harvey AI $200M raise at $11B (from Feb 19) remains the latest major competitive event. Blue Prism rebranding to agentic continues — threat level remains 🟡 Medium (enterprise relationships but weak AI-native capability).

## Severity
- 🟢 All findings are background intelligence — no urgent action required today
- 🟡 Brave API quota at 88.5% — will hit limit before month-end if pace continues

## Evening Synthesis (20:12 GMT)

1. **Agent governance is our Step 2 product, not just positioning.** Today's intel crystallizes something: "Agent Audit" ($15-25K fixed-price assessment → $120K implementation) is the concrete Step 2 wedge. Every enterprise deploying Copilot/ChatGPT has sprawl. We assess, consolidate, orchestrate. This is the bridge from skills to service accounts.

2. **Market fragmentation is our window.** Mid-tier firms (Kanerika) getting listed alongside OpenAI and Microsoft as "agentic AI companies" proves the market isn't winner-take-all. Vertical depth beats horizontal breadth. But the window narrows as Blue Prism and legacy RPA vendors pile in with existing enterprise relationships.

3. **JPMorgan KYC/AML precedent unlocks insurance outreach.** We have 20 insurance agencies in CRM. JPMorgan's public deployment of compliance AI agents is the reference case these buyers need. "JPMorgan automated KYC with AI agents. Your claims process is next." That's the email hook.

4. **Brave API quota is a real operational constraint.** At 88.5% with 8 days left in February, morning research will be degraded. Either upgrade to paid tier or reduce daily search volume. This affects all agents, not just Strategist.

5. **No new competitive threats today.** Harvey at $11B and Blue Prism's pivot remain the key moves. Saturday intel was thin due to quota limits — Monday morning will need a deeper scan.
