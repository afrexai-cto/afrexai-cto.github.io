# 🔮 Daily Intel — 2026-02-25 (Wednesday)

## ⚠️ Brave Search API: DEAD

Quota exceeded (2001/2000). **Zero web research possible today.** This is the second week running hot. All research agents are blind.

**🔴 URGENT ACTION:** Upgrade Brave Search plan or add alternative search provider. Every day without research = flying blind on competitive moves.

## Pipeline Diagnosis: Critical Stall

### The Numbers
- **11 deals** — ALL stage: prospecting, ALL $120K, ALL owner: Sage, ALL "AI Governance Framework"
- **Zero contacts linked** to any deal
- **Zero close dates** set
- **Zero stage advancement** since creation (Feb 20)
- **100 Real Estate companies** in CRM with **ZERO deals**
- **20 Insurance Agencies** in CRM with **ZERO deals**

### What This Means
We have a CRM full of companies and a pipeline that's a copy-paste artifact. No real sales motion is happening. The deals aren't deals — they're wishful thinking entries with no contact, no timeline, no next action.

### The Fix (Prioritized)
1. **Link contacts to existing deals** — can't sell to a company, only to a person
2. **Set close dates** — no date = no urgency = no deal
3. **Create Real Estate deals** — 100 companies, our largest vertical, zero pipeline. This is the fastest path to volume.
4. **Diversify deal types** — "AI Governance Framework" × 11 is concentration risk. Add AaaS ($5,500/mo), Agent Setup ($3,500 intro), and vertical-specific offers.

## Opportunity: Real Estate Pipeline Sprint

100 real estate companies sitting cold. Real estate is:
- High transaction volume = high automation ROI
- Tech-forward buyers (PropTech adoption accelerating)
- Lower compliance burden than fintech/legal = faster sales cycle
- Sean Ford (Skilled Real Estate, Miami) already an inbound lead

**Recommendation:** Create 10 Real Estate deals this week targeting top ICP-scored companies. Use Sean Ford as the proof case.

## Strategic Flags

### 🔴 Brave API Quota — Blocks ALL Research
Every agent relying on web search is degraded. This isn't a nice-to-have — competitive intelligence, prospect research, and content creation all depend on it.

### 🟡 Pipeline Homogeneity
Single deal type, single owner, single stage. If Sage's approach doesn't convert, we have zero fallback. Diversify NOW.

### 🟡 5 Days Without Stage Movement
Deals created Feb 20, today is Feb 25. No contact linked, no outreach logged, no advancement. These deals are aging out before they start.

## No New Inbound Handoffs
- `input/from-consultant/`: empty
- `input/from-marketing-analyst/`: no new files (all pre-existing research)
