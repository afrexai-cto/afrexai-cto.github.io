## Strategic Position

**Our lane:** Vertical implementation services with measurable ROI. Platform players commoditize tooling (good for us). Pure AI startups lack enterprise delivery muscle. Big consultancies are slow and expensive. We sit in the gap.

**Biggest threat:** Thomson Reuters in legal — they own the data, the distribution, and the trust. We compete on speed, cost, and customization depth.
