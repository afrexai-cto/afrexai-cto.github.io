## Top 5 Findings

### 1. 🔴 AI Scare Trade Hammering Financial Services & Legal Stocks
Wall Street is in full "who's next?" panic mode. Anthropic's legal AI plug-in triggered a selloff that spread from software to brokerages, data analytics, and legal services. S&P 500 Software & Services index lost ~$2T from peak. Altruist's AI-enabled tax planning features spooked wealth management stocks (LPL -7%, Raymond James -7%, Schwab -7%). S&P Global down 25% in February alone.

**Strategic implication:** This is our tailwind, not headwind. When incumbents' stock prices crash on AI fear, their *customers* are looking for implementation partners. Fear creates urgency. The enterprises watching their service providers tank are now asking "should WE be doing this before it's done TO us?" That's our buyer.

### 2. 🟡 Agentic AI vs RPA Narrative Crossing Mainstream
Medium and enterprise publications now framing 2026 as the year agentic AI definitively replaces traditional RPA. The argument: RPA automates tasks, agentic AI automates decisions. This distinction matters for our positioning — we're not selling "faster bots," we're selling judgment at scale.

**Strategic implication:** Language shift from "automation" to "agentic" helps us. "Recovered capacity" framing now has industry validation — agents don't just do tasks faster, they make decisions humans used to make. Price accordingly.

### 3. 🟡 Riff White Paper: "Why Agentic AI Might Deliver Where Digital Transformation Failed"
Riff's COO argues the gap between expertise and execution is narrowing — domain experts can now translate operational knowledge directly into working software. Key insight: the 2010s digital transformation failed because custom software economics didn't work. Agentic AI changes the economics.

**Strategic implication:** This validates our Step 1→2 transition thesis. Skills (Step 1) prove we can encode domain expertise. Service Accounts (Step 2) deliver that expertise as working systems. The white paper's framing — "domain experts translating knowledge into software" — is literally what our vertical context packs do.

### 4. 🟢 Healthcare AI Claims Automation Going Vertical-Specific
AI-enabled ICD-10 claims automation for specialty practices (podiatric) shows the market is fragmenting into hyper-specific verticals. Not "healthcare AI" but "podiatric billing AI." India AI Summit also highlighting sector-specific deployments.

**Strategic implication:** Confirms our vertical specialization thesis. The winners won't be horizontal "AI for healthcare" — they'll be "AI for [specific workflow] in [specific practice type]." Go narrower, not wider.

### 5. 🟡 UK Finance Report: AI "Fundamentally Transforming" Financial Services
UK Finance published insights on AI transforming customer interactions, fraud prevention, and investment strategies. While UK-focused, the same dynamics apply to US market — and UK adoption patterns often preview US enterprise behavior 6-12 months later.

**Strategic implication:** Monitor for cross-Atlantic pattern matching. If UK financial services are adopting now, US mid-market will follow. Our US-first strategy is correctly timed.

## Competitive Updates
- **Anthropic** — Released legal AI plug-in that triggered market-wide selloff. They're moving from model provider to vertical solution. Watch closely — if they go direct to legal enterprises, they compress our legal vertical opportunity.
- No other significant competitor moves in past 24h.

## Risk Flag
🟡 **Anthropic entering legal vertical directly.** Their legal AI plug-in triggered a market selloff, which means it's credible enough to scare investors. If Anthropic moves from plug-in to full legal workflow automation, Thomson Reuters AND AfrexAI face platform-layer competition. Mitigation: our value is implementation + domain expertise + ongoing optimization, not the model itself. But monitor weekly.
