## AfrexAI Strategist | UK Market Intelligence

### Why This Matters
AfrexAI isn't competing in a vacuum. By 2026, UK buyers evaluating AI automation
have 3-5 alternatives on their shortlist. Understanding why AfrexAI wins — and why
it loses — is the fastest path to refining positioning, pricing, and sales approach.

### Competitor Categories

#### Category 1: UK Boutique AI Agencies
**Examples:** Faculty AI, Deeper Insights, Peak AI, Satalia (now WPP)
- Typically target enterprise/upper-mid-market
- Pricing: £10K-£50K+ projects
- Strengths: Brand recognition, large case studies, data science depth
- Weakness against AfrexAI: Over-engineered for mid-market, slow delivery, expensive

**AfrexAI counter-positioning:**
"We deliver in weeks, not months. Purpose-built for companies your size."

#### Category 2: Freelance AI Developers / Consultants
**Estimated UK count:** 5,000+ on Upwork, Toptal, direct
- Pricing: £50-£150/hr or £2K-£10K projects
- Strengths: Cheap, flexible, fast for simple tasks
- Weakness against AfrexAI: No ongoing support, quality variance, single point of failure

**AfrexAI counter-positioning:**
"We're a team, not a freelancer. We maintain what we build."

#### Category 3: DIY Automation Platforms
**Examples:** Relevance AI, Bardeen, Make.com, Zapier (with AI features)
- Pricing: £50-£500/month self-serve
- Strengths: Low cost, instant start, no dependency on agency
- Weakness against AfrexAI: Limited complexity, requires internal expertise, breaks at scale

**AfrexAI counter-positioning:**
"When Zapier hits its limits, we take over. Done-for-you beats DIY."

#### Category 4: Offshore AI Agencies
**Hubs:** India, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia
- Pricing: 50-70% cheaper than UK agencies
- Strengths: Cost, large teams, 24-hour dev cycles
- Weakness against AfrexAI: Timezone friction, cultural misalignment, GDPR concerns, communication overhead

**AfrexAI counter-positioning:**
"UK-based, UK-timezone, UK-compliant. No lost-in-translation moments."

#### Category 5: In-House Build
**The hidden competitor — prospect's own team**
- Cost: £60K-£90K/year for a UK AI/ML engineer + tools + management overhead
- Strengths: Full control, IP ownership, deep context
- Weakness: Slow to hire, expensive to retain, distracted by other priorities

**AfrexAI counter-positioning:**
"Get AI automation live in 4 weeks. Hiring takes 3 months before day one."

### Win/Loss Analysis Process

#### Capture Data (Every Deal)
After every closed-won or closed-lost, record:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| Company name | Acme SaaS Ltd |
| Vertical | B2B SaaS |
| Deal size | £2,500/mo |
| Outcome | Won / Lost / No Decision |
| Competitors evaluated | Faculty, freelancer, in-house |
| Primary win/loss reason | Speed to value / Price / Trust |
| Decision maker role | COO |
| Sales cycle length | 3 weeks |
| Objections raised | Budget, timing, risk |
| Source | Cold outbound / Referral / Inbound |

#### Analyse Quarterly
Every quarter, review all deals and answer:

1. **What % did we win vs. each competitor type?**
   - Target: >50% win rate against freelancers, >40% against DIY platforms
2. **What was the #1 reason for losses?**
   - Price → adjust positioning or introduce lower tier
   - Trust → need more case studies, social proof
   - Timing → nurture sequence isn't working
   - Feature gap → product/service roadmap input
3. **Which verticals have the highest win rate?**
   - Double down on the vertical where AfrexAI wins most
4. **Which deal source has highest close rate?**
   - Referrals typically close at 2-3x the rate of cold outbound
5. **What's the average sales cycle?**
   - Target: <4 weeks for Starter, <6 weeks for Growth, <8 weeks for Scale

### Key Insight for 2026
The biggest competitive threat isn't another agency — it's **no decision**.
40-60% of B2B sales opportunities end in "do nothing."
AfrexAI's real competition is inertia. Every piece of messaging, every follow-up,
every case study should answer: "Why now? Why not wait another quarter?"

Answer: "Every month you delay, you're paying £X in wasted time.
Our pilot takes 4 weeks. In 60 days, you'll know exactly what AI saves you."
