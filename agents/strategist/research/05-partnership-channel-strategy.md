# Partnership & Channel Strategy — Referral Partners, Agency Partnerships, Channel Revenue
## AfrexAI Strategist | Path to 30% of £1M ARR via Partners

### Revenue Target from Partnerships
Goal: 30% of £1M ARR = £300K ARR from partner-sourced deals by end of 2026.
That's ~10 clients at £2,500/mo avg sourced through partners.
Partner-referred deals close 2-3x faster and have 25% higher LTV than cold outbound.

### Partner Types & Structure

## 1. Referral Partners (Individual)
**Who:** Fractional COOs, business coaches, accountants, management consultants
**Why:** They sit inside companies daily, hear pain points, but can't solve AI problems.
**Deal:** 10% of first-year revenue per referred client that converts.
- £2,500/mo client = £3,000 referral fee (paid over 12 months or upfront at close)
- Upfront payment incentivises volume; monthly payment aligns incentives on retention.

**Target partners (UK-specific):**
- Fractional COO networks: The COO Alliance, independent fractional ops consultants
- Business coaches/advisors: Vistage, EO (Entrepreneurs' Organisation) members
- Accountants serving SMEs: Not Big 4 — target mid-tier firms (BDO, Grant Thornton partners, or independents)
- Management consultants: Solo or small-firm strategy consultants

**Activation playbook:**
1. Identify 50 potential referral partners via LinkedIn (UK-based, serving 20-200 employee companies)
2. Reach out with value-first message: "I help your clients automate operations with AI. When you spot a client drowning in manual work, I'd love to be your recommendation."
3. Offer a free "AI Readiness Assessment" they can give to their clients (AfrexAI-branded)
4. Monthly partner newsletter: new case studies, what's working, referral leaderboard
5. Quarterly partner calls: share learnings, get feedback, strengthen relationship

**Target: 20 active referral partners by Q4 2026, each referring 1-2 clients/year.**

## 2. Technology Partners (Platform Ecosystem)
**Who:** HubSpot Solutions Partners, Salesforce consultants, Xero/QuickBooks advisors
**Why:** They implement the platforms that AfrexAI builds AI on top of. Perfect handoff.
**Deal:** Mutual referral (no cash — they send AI work to us, we send CRM/platform work to them).

**Priority partnerships:**

#### HubSpot Solutions Partner Network
- 2,000+ HubSpot partners in the UK
- HubSpot clients = AfrexAI ICP (tech-forward, 20-200 employees, using CRM)
- Joint value prop: "HubSpot for your CRM, AfrexAI for AI automation on top"
- Become a HubSpot Solutions Partner (even at base tier) for directory listing + credibility
- Co-create content: "5 AI Automations Every HubSpot User Should Have"

#### Salesforce Consulting Partners
- Larger clients, but Salesforce ecosystem is vast
- Target boutique Salesforce consultants (not Deloitte Digital)
- Joint webinars on "AI-Powered Salesforce Workflows"

#### Xero/QuickBooks Advisor Networks
- Access to professional services firms (accounting, legal)
- These advisors are trusted — their recommendation carries enormous weight
- Offer to build automations that pull from Xero/QB data

**Target: 5 active technology partnerships by Q4 2026.**

## 3. Agency Partnerships (White Label / Co-Delivery)
**Who:** Digital agencies, marketing agencies, dev agencies that get asked about AI
**Why:** They have the client relationships. They need AI capability. AfrexAI delivers it.
**Deal options:**
- **White label:** Agency resells AfrexAI under their brand. AfrexAI delivers at 60-70% of retail price.
- **Co-delivery:** Joint proposal, both brands visible, revenue split 60/40 (AfrexAI/agency).
- **Referral:** Agency sends client directly, gets 15% ongoing commission.

**Ideal agency partners:**
- 10-50 person digital/marketing agencies
- Already offering "digital transformation" but lack AI capability
- Serving AfrexAI's target verticals (SaaS, professional services)
- UK-based with strong client portfolios

**Activation playbook:**
1. Identify 30 UK agencies that match criteria (Agency Collective, BIMA directory, Clutch UK)
2. Approach founder/MD: "Your clients are asking about AI. We can be your AI arm."
3. Start with one joint client as proof of concept
4. Formalise partnership after first successful delivery
5. Provide agency with co-branded sales materials, case studies, pitch deck

**Revenue model example:**
Agency charges client £4,000/mo for "AI-powered operations" package.
AfrexAI delivers for £2,500/mo (white label).
Agency keeps £1,500/mo margin. AfrexAI books £2,500/mo revenue.
Both happy. Client doesn't know or care.

**Target: 3-5 active agency partnerships by Q4 2026, each bringing 2-3 clients.**

---

## 4. Community & Ecosystem Partnerships
**Who:** Industry associations, accelerators, events
**Why:** Credibility, exposure, deal flow from curated networks

**Priority:**
- **Tech Nation / Barclays Eagle Labs** — startup ecosystem, speaking opportunities
- **SaaStock** — B2B SaaS community, sponsor workshops
- **Agency Collective** — 1,000+ UK agency founders, highly engaged
- **Vistage / YPO** — CEO peer groups, speaking = direct access to buyers
- **Local tech meetups** — London, Manchester, Bristol tech communities

**Don't pay for logo placement.** Instead:
- Offer free workshops/talks (positions as expert, generates leads)
- Create co-branded content (both parties promote)
- Sponsor specific events with speaking slots included

### Partner Enablement Kit
Every partner gets:

| Asset | Purpose |
|---|---|
| One-page overview of AfrexAI | Quick reference for conversations |
| AI Readiness Assessment template | Tool they can offer their clients |
| 3 case studies (one per vertical) | Proof points they can share |
| Referral tracking link/form | Easy submission, transparent tracking |
| Co-branded slide deck | For joint presentations |
| Partner-only pricing sheet | Shows their commission/margin clearly |
| Monthly partner newsletter | Keeps AfrexAI top of mind |

### Partner Revenue Tracking

| Metric | Q1 Target | Q2 Target | Q3 Target | Q4 Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Active referral partners | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
| Active tech partners | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| Active agency partners | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| Partner-sourced leads | 5 | 15 | 30 | 50 |
| Partner-sourced revenue (ARR) | £30K | £90K | £180K | £300K |

### Partnership Red Flags (Avoid These Partners)
- Agencies that want to own the client relationship AND pay you per-project (no recurring)
- Partners who refer unqualified leads (waste your sales time)
- Companies that want equity/partnership stake in exchange for introductions
- Anyone asking for exclusive territory rights before proving they can deliver volume
- Partners in financial distress (their clients may be too)

### 90-Day Partnership Launch Plan
**Month 1:** Identify and shortlist 20 referral + 10 tech + 10 agency prospects
**Month 2:** Reach out, have intro calls, identify 5 serious prospects per category
**Month 3:** Formalise first 3-5 partnerships, deliver enablement kit, land first partner-sourced deal

Key hire consideration: By Q3 2026, if partnerships are working, hire a part-time
Partnership Manager (£40-50K pro-rata) to scale the programme beyond founder capacity.
