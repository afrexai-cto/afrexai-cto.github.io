## Top 5 Findings

### 1. Harvey AI raising $200M at $11B valuation
Harvey is in talks for another $200M round at ~$11B (up from $8B in Dec 2025). Stinson LLP just rolled out Harvey firmwide after 100+ attorney pilot. Dallas office still on track for April.
- **Impact:** Harvey is accelerating fast. The $11B valuation and law firm adoptions validate the legal AI market but compress our window. They're winning supply-side (law firms). Our demand-side play (corporate legal ops, GC revolt) remains open.

### 2. AIG deploys agentic AI with full orchestration layer
AIG has deployed agentic AI across front-to-back workflows — intake, risk assessment, claims handling. Using orchestration to compress cycle times.
- **Impact:** Insurance giants are now BUYERS, not tire-kickers. This validates our insurance sub-vertical under Financial Services. AIG's public case study is a reference we can use in outreach to mid-market insurers who want what AIG has.

### 3. Microsoft publishes "How Agentic AI is Transforming Insurance"
Microsoft Industry Blog (yesterday) — IDC study shows early AI adopters in insurance report 3x higher returns than slow adopters. Microsoft framing agentic AI as the next platform shift for insurers.
- **Impact:** Microsoft is doing our market education for free, again. This validates both the insurance vertical AND our "recovered capacity" framing (Microsoft is pushing similar ROI language). Position as implementation layer.

### 4. MIT Sloan publishes "Agentic AI Explained" — mainstreaming the concept
MIT Sloan broke down agentic AI for business leaders. JPMorgan Chase exploring agents for fraud detection, loan approvals, compliance. Key concern: permission-based security systems.
- **Impact:** When MIT Sloan explains your market category to MBAs, you're past the education phase. Enterprise buyers now understand WHAT agentic AI is. The question shifts to WHO implements it. That's us.

### 5. Genpact/CIO: "Autonomous Enterprise" framing gaining traction
CIO.com published on enterprises building "fleets of smart agents" paired with human operators. Genpact calls it "Autonomy by Design." Goes beyond automation into real-time decision-making.
- **Impact:** The narrative is shifting from "AI automation" to "autonomous enterprise." Our positioning should mirror this — we're not selling bots, we're building autonomous business operations.

## Strategic Flags

🟡 **Harvey at $11B is a validation signal, not a death sentence.** They serve law firms (supply side). Corporate legal departments (demand side) are frustrated with law firms' AI markup. Our "bypass the law firm AI tax" messaging is more relevant than ever.

🟡 **Insurance is ready NOW.** AIG, Microsoft, PYMNTS all pointing to insurance as the hottest vertical for agentic AI deployment. Mid-market insurers want what AIG has but can't build it themselves. This is our sweet spot.

🟢 **Market education phase is OVER.** MIT Sloan, CIO, Microsoft all explaining agentic AI to business leaders. We no longer need to explain what we do — we explain why we're better.
