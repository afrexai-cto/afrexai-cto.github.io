## Top Findings

### 1. SaaSpocalypse Deepens — $285B Wiped, Our Window Widens
The Anthropic Claude Cowork plugin launch (legal, financial, sales workflows) triggered a $285B market cap wipeout last Monday. Thomson Reuters lost $8.2B in a single day. LegalZoom dropped 20%. India's Nifty IT posted its worst month since Oct 2008. A Jefferies trader coined "SaaSpocalypse" — mood described as "get me out" selling.

**Strategic read:** This is pure tailwind. Every enterprise CIO is now fielding board questions about AI readiness. Fear of disruption = budget allocation. Our "recovered capacity" framing is exactly what panicking buyers need — measurable, defensible, not hype. The window to land enterprise conversations has never been wider.

### 2. Healthcare Prior Authorization — CMS 2026 Mandate Creates Forced Buyers
CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule (CMS-0057-F) mandates FHIR-based APIs by 2027 with strict decision timeframes starting 2026. Analysis shows AI-enabled prior auth can automate 50-75% of manual tasks. Araya just launched "Max" (AI prior auth solution). Mastech Digital published agentic AI prior auth blueprint.

**Strategic read:** This is a regulatory-forced buying event in healthcare. Payers MUST act in 2026. Prior authorization is document-heavy, rules-based, high-volume — ideal for agentic AI. New entrants (Araya, Mastech) validate the market but lack our vertical depth thesis. Healthcare prior auth could be a strong beachhead alongside legal.

### 3. OpenClaw Gets Business Insider Coverage — Bottom-Up Disruption Validated
Business Insider featured OpenClaw alongside Claude Cowork as twin disruption vectors — Cowork top-down from well-funded lab, OpenClaw bottom-up from open source. The article positions messaging-first AI assistants as a legitimate enterprise channel.

**Strategic read:** Our entire ClawHub distribution thesis just got mainstream media validation. OpenClaw users are our developer funnel. As the platform grows, our skills marketplace becomes more valuable. Monitor for OpenClaw enterprise adoption — could become a channel partner play.

### 4. "Jagged Frontier" Framework Gaining Traction
Multiple commentators (including 28-year industry veterans) describing AI disruption using Melanie Mitchell's "jagged frontier" — routine, well-defined work accelerates first while judgment-heavy tasks remain harder. This explains why legal document review, prior auth, and financial compliance are getting automated first.

**Strategic read:** Validates our vertical selection. All three target verticals (legal, financial services, healthcare) have massive "well-defined work" surface areas that sit below the jagged frontier. The judgment layer is where we add human-in-the-loop value. Frame our service as: "We automate everything below the frontier, your people handle everything above it."

## Signals to Watch
- Claude Cowork plugin ecosystem expansion (which verticals next?)
- CMS enforcement timeline — any delays or accelerations
- OpenClaw enterprise adoption metrics
- Thomson Reuters response to market selloff (will they acquire or build faster?)
