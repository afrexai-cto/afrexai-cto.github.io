## Top 5 Findings

### 1. Harvey AI Hits 25,000 Custom Workflows — Growth Accelerating
Harvey now has 25,000+ custom workflows deployed across law firms. They're still taking demo requests (growth mode, not capacity-constrained). The messaging shift to "demonstrable ROI" over "cool technology" mirrors our recovered-capacity framing. **Implication:** Harvey is validating our thesis but at scale. The window to differentiate on implementation depth for mid-market legal is narrowing.

### 2. Harvey Partners with Gabriel Macht ("Suits" Actor) — Brand Play
Harvey AI signed Gabriel Macht as brand spokesperson (Feb 17). This is a consumer-awareness play unusual for enterprise legal tech. Signals Harvey is expanding beyond BigLaw into mid-market and in-house counsel — directly into our target segment. **Threat level elevated.**

### 3. McKinsey: 25% of Enterprise Workflows Automated by Agentic AI by 2028
New McKinsey data point being cited across industry: quarter of enterprise workflows will run on agentic AI within 2 years. This is our TAM validator. Every enterprise conversation should reference this stat — it creates urgency without us having to manufacture it.

### 4. Agentic ERP Emerging — Business Central Going Autonomous
Microsoft Business Central integrating agentic capabilities directly into ERP. This confirms platform-layer commoditization thesis — the tools become free/cheap, implementation becomes the product. Supports our Step 2 timing.

### 5. SS&C Blue Prism Rebranding as "Agentic Automation Company"
Legacy RPA player Blue Prism now positioning as agentic AI. The old guard is pivoting. This means enterprise buyers are hearing "agentic" from trusted vendors — reduces our education burden but increases noise. Differentiation must be vertical-specific outcomes, not generic "agentic" claims.

## Strategic Synthesis

The legal AI space is getting **loud**. Harvey's brand spokesperson move + 25K workflows + Anthropic's direct entry + Thomson Reuters' incumbency = crowded top of market. However, mid-market legal (firms with 50-200 attorneys, corporate legal departments) remains underserved by these players who chase BigLaw and Fortune 500.

**Contrarian read:** The noise actually helps us. When Harvey spends marketing dollars educating the market, every GC who Googles "legal AI" becomes a warmer lead for *anyone* selling implementation. We don't need to educate — we need to be findable when they're ready to buy.

**Actionable:** The GC revolt signal from Feb 16 memory + Harvey's mid-market push = urgency to get our legal vertical outbound running this week. Every day we wait, Harvey gets closer to the mid-market buyers who should be ours.
