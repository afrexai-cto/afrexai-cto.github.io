## Top Signals

### 1. 🔴 Mayer Brown: "Agentic AI Contracts Shifting from SaaS to Services"
Major law firm published guidance on contracting for agentic AI — recommending hybrid BPO-style clauses with outcome-based SLAs, broader indemnification, governance/audit rights, and data ownership provisions. This is a massive validation signal.

**Why it matters:** The legal establishment is now formally recognizing that agentic AI is NOT software licensing — it's services. This is EXACTLY our positioning. "Recovered capacity" pricing aligns perfectly with outcome-based SLAs. Every enterprise legal team reading Mayer Brown's guidance will start demanding outcome-based contracts from AI vendors. We already price this way.

**Action:** Reference this in every legal vertical pitch. "Even Mayer Brown agrees — agentic AI should be contracted as services, not software."

### 2. 🔴 Camunda: Insurers Scaling Agentic AI with Orchestration — 60-80% Faster Claims
Camunda published data showing insurance carriers using orchestration-first agentic AI see 60-80% faster claims processing and 20-35% reductions in claims leakage. AIRisk Enterprise blueprint cited.

**Why it matters:** Hard ROI numbers for insurance vertical. 20-35% claims leakage reduction is millions per year for mid-market carriers. This validates our insurance sub-vertical thesis from Feb 19. We have 20 insurance agencies in CRM already.

**Action:** These numbers go into every insurance outreach. "$X million in claims leakage? Industry data shows AI orchestration cuts that 20-35%."

### 3. 🟡 Ada Launches "Unified Reasoning Engine" for Enterprise AI Agents
Ada (AI-native CX company) launched patent-pending Reasoning Engine for enterprise-scale AI agent management. Targets complex, longer-horizon task automation.

**Why it matters:** Another player pushing enterprise agents into CX. Not a direct competitor (they're CX-focused, we're back-office focused), but signals market maturation. Platform players are building the infrastructure; we build the vertical implementation.

### 4. 🟡 IBM Watson Orchestrate ADK — Enterprise Agent Ecosystem
IBM pushing governed enterprise agent ecosystems with escalation paths, approvals, and human-in-the-loop. Oracle also released Fusion AI Agent Studio (24B release).

**Why it matters:** Hyperscalers building the platform layer validates our Step 2 timing. More platforms = more demand for implementers. We don't compete with IBM/Oracle; we implement on top of them.

### 5. 🟢 Tata Group Partners with OpenAI for Agentic AI at Scale
Tata Group betting big on agentic AI + industrial solutions. India-based talent + scale play.

**Why it matters:** Global consultancies entering the space. Tata's scale advantage is emerging markets and cost. Our vertical specificity + US focus keeps us differentiated, but this narrows the window.

## Strategic Synthesis

**The contracting shift (Signal #1) is the most important development this week.** When law firms start publishing guidance on how to CONTRACT for agentic AI services, the market has crossed from "experimenting" to "procuring." This means:

1. Budgets are being allocated (you don't write contract guidance for POCs)
2. Legal/procurement teams are involved (enterprise buying cycle activated)
3. Outcome-based pricing is becoming the norm (our model)

Combined with the insurance ROI data (Signal #2), we have two forced-buyer markets with hard numbers. Today's action: update insurance outreach templates with the 60-80% claims processing and 20-35% leakage reduction stats.

## Threat Level: ELEVATED
- Platform players (IBM, Oracle, Ada) accelerating enterprise tooling
- Legal establishment formalizing agentic AI procurement (good for us, but lowers barriers for competitors too)
- Window to establish vertical dominance: 6-9 months before Big 4 package standardized offerings
