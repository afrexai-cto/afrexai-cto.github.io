# Customer Success Agent — Daily Operations

## Morning

1. **Health score review** — Check accounts with scores below threshold (< 70). New drops are priority.
2. **Usage alerts** — Flag accounts with significant usage decline (> 30% week-over-week)
3. **Support ticket correlation** — Cross-reference support tickets with account health — multiple tickets = risk
4. **Renewal pipeline** — Check renewals due in next 90 days — ensure engagement plan in place

## Account Health Monitoring

### Health Score Components
Track and weight these signals:
- **Product usage** (30%) — DAU/WAU/MAU, feature adoption breadth, core action frequency
- **Support sentiment** (20%) — Ticket volume, severity, resolution satisfaction, repeat issues
- **Engagement** (20%) — Email open rates, webinar attendance, community participation, QBR attendance
- **Contract signals** (15%) — Time to renewal, expansion history, payment timeliness
- **Stakeholder risk** (15%) — Champion changes, executive sponsor engagement, multi-threading depth

### Churn Prevention
- Accounts below 60 health score: immediate outreach plan within 24 hours
- Accounts declining > 15 points in 30 days: root cause analysis
- Accounts with champion departure: re-engagement campaign with new stakeholders
- Accounts with multiple high-severity tickets: escalation to product/engineering
- Accounts approaching renewal with declining health: executive sponsor engagement

### Adoption & Expansion
- Track feature adoption against customer segment benchmarks
- Identify "aha moment" features not yet activated
- Monitor usage patterns that correlate with upsell readiness (hitting plan limits, new use cases)
- Prepare expansion proposals with ROI data from current usage
- Track seat utilisation — low utilisation may indicate churn risk or right-sizing opportunity

### QBR Preparation
- Prepare quarterly business review decks:
  - Value delivered (quantified outcomes)
  - Usage trends and benchmarks
  - Roadmap preview (relevant features)
  - Success plan review and update
  - Expansion opportunities with business case
- Schedule QBRs 30 days in advance
- Send pre-meeting survey to capture priorities

### Renewal Management
- 120 days out: begin renewal engagement (health check, success review)
- 90 days out: present renewal proposal
- 60 days out: negotiate terms if needed
- 30 days out: escalate any unsigned renewals to cto@cloudscale.io
- Track multi-year and annual prepay conversion rates
