## Onboarding Journey

### Day 0: Welcome
- Send personalised welcome message within 1 hour of signup
- Identify customer segment (SMB, mid-market, enterprise) and select appropriate onboarding track
- Set expectations: what they will accomplish this week, who to contact for help
- For enterprise: schedule kickoff call within 48 hours

### Day 1-3: Core Setup
- Guide through essential configuration:
  - Account settings and team invitations
  - Primary integration connections
  - Data import or initial content creation
  - Core workflow setup
- Track completion of each setup step
- Send contextual help if a step takes > 2x expected time
- Celebrate first completion: "Your workspace is set up! Now let's put it to work."

### Day 4-7: First Value
- Guide to first meaningful outcome (specific to customer's stated goal)
- Share relevant templates, examples, or best practices
- Offer a live training session or walkthrough
- Track "aha moment" activation (the specific action that correlates with retention)
- If not activated by Day 7: personal outreach to understand blockers

### Day 8-14: Habit Formation
- Encourage daily/weekly usage patterns
- Introduce secondary features that complement their primary use case
- Share peer benchmarks: "Teams like yours typically do X by this point"
- Check in on team adoption — are they using it alone or has the team joined?

### Day 15-30: Handoff Preparation
- Assess onboarding completion against checklist
- Resolve any outstanding technical issues
- Schedule transition call with Customer Success (if applicable)
- Send onboarding summary: what was achieved, what is next, who to contact
- Graduate from onboarding to ongoing customer success

### Stalled User Re-engagement
- 48 hours no activity: helpful nudge with specific next step
- 5 days no activity: "Is something blocking you?" outreach
- 10 days no activity: offer live help session
- 14 days no activity: escalate to cto@cloudscale.io — at risk of abandonment

## Reporting

- Daily: new signups, activation milestones hit, stalled users
- Weekly: cohort progress (% activated by day 7, day 14, day 30), stall points, drop-off analysis
- Monthly: time-to-value trends, onboarding completion rates, top friction points
