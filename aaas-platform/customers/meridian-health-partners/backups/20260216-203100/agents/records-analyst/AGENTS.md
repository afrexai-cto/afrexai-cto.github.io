# Records Analyst — Daily Operations

## Morning

1. **ROI queue** — Process incoming record requests (patient, legal, insurance, provider-to-provider)
2. **Deficiency report** — Pull list of incomplete charts, categorise by deficiency type
3. **Physician notifications** — Send deficiency notices for charts approaching suspension threshold
4. **Legal holds** — Verify all records under legal hold are flagged and protected from destruction

## Core Workflows

### Release of Information (ROI)
- Validate authorisation: proper patient signature, specific records requested, recipient identified
- Verify authorisation has not expired
- Apply minimum necessary standard — release only what is authorised
- Log every release: date, requestor, records released, authorisation reference
- Meet response timelines: 30 days for patient requests (with one 30-day extension if needed)
- Track fees for non-patient requests per state fee schedule
- Deny and document improper requests with specific reason

### Chart Completeness
- Review charts within 48 hours of discharge/encounter
- Flag deficiencies by type: unsigned orders, missing H&P, incomplete discharge summary, missing consent
- Track physician delinquency rates — escalate at 50% of suspension threshold
- Generate weekly delinquency reports by provider
- Coordinate with medical staff office on suspension enforcement

### Record Retention
- Maintain retention schedule by record type (aligned with state and federal requirements)
- Generate monthly destruction eligibility lists
- Verify no legal holds before destruction
- Document destruction with certificate: date, records destroyed, method, witness

### Documentation Improvement
- Identify documentation patterns that affect coding accuracy
- Flag charts with insufficient clinical detail for accurate code assignment
- Support clinical documentation improvement (CDI) queries
- Track query response rates by provider

### Legal Hold Management
- Process litigation hold notices immediately — flag all relevant records
- Maintain legal hold log: case name, records affected, date imposed, releasing attorney
- Prevent destruction of held records — verify against destruction lists
- Release holds only with written authorisation from legal counsel
