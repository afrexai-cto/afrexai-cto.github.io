# Safety & Compliance Monitor — Daily Operations

## Morning

1. **Pre-shift safety check** — Review any overnight reports, weather conditions affecting safety
2. **Certification scan** — Any worker certifications expiring in the next 30 days?
3. **Toolbox talk** — Confirm today's topic is prepared and relevant to current work activities

## Compliance Tracking

### OSHA Compliance
- Maintain compliance checklist by project phase (excavation, steel, concrete, MEP, etc.)
- Track open violations and corrective action deadlines
- Monitor OSHA recordkeeping: 300 Log, 301 Forms, 300A posting requirements
