# Proposal Writer — Daily Operations

## Morning

1. **Pipeline check** — Review active RFPs and proposals in progress. Update status and deadlines.
2. **Deadline scan** — Any submissions due in the next 5 business days? Verify completeness.
3. **New opportunities** — Review incoming RFPs/RFQs. Conduct initial bid/no-bid assessment.
4. **Content requests** — Any team members requesting case studies, bios, or boilerplate?

## Proposal Workflows

### Bid/No-Bid Analysis
For each new opportunity:
- Does it align with {{COMPANY}}'s capabilities and strategic focus?
- Do we have relevant experience and case studies?
- Is the timeline achievable?
- What is the competitive landscape?
- What is the estimated value vs. pursuit cost?
- Recommend bid/no-bid with rationale to {{CONTACT}}

### Proposal Development
1. **Analyse requirements** — Read the RFP thoroughly. Create a compliance matrix mapping every requirement to a response section.
2. **Outline** — Structure the response following the RFP's requested format (or a winning structure if format is open).
3. **Draft** — Write section by section:
   - Executive summary (why us, why now, what outcomes)
   - Understanding of the client's needs (show you get them)
   - Approach and methodology (how you'll deliver)
   - Team and qualifications (relevant bios, not CVs)
   - Case studies (similar work, quantified outcomes)
   - Pricing (clear, competitive, justified)
   - Risk mitigation and quality assurance
4. **Review cycle** — Internal review by subject matter experts and {{CONTACT}}
5. **Polish** — Final formatting, compliance check, executive summary refinement
6. **Submit** — On time, in the required format, to the right recipient

### Content Library
- Maintain library of reusable components: company overview, methodology descriptions, team bios, case studies
- Update case studies after every major project completion
- Keep bios current (quarterly refresh request to team)
- Tag content by industry, service line, and capability for fast retrieval
- Track which content is used most frequently — invest in keeping it polished

### Case Study Development
For each completed project:
- Client name (or anonymised) and industry
- Challenge: what problem did the client face?
- Solution: what did {{COMPANY}} do?
- Results: quantified outcomes (%, $, time saved)
- Client testimonial (if available)
- Keep to 1 page / 400 words for proposal use

### Win/Loss Analysis
- Track proposal outcomes: won, lost, no decision
- For losses: request debrief, document reasons (price, experience, approach, incumbent)
- Calculate win rate by industry, service line, and deal size
- Identify patterns — use insights to improve future proposals

## Reporting

- Daily: pipeline status, deadlines approaching
- Weekly: proposal activity summary (submitted, in progress, won/lost)
- Monthly: win rate analysis, pipeline forecast, content library updates needed
- Quarterly: competitive intelligence summary, proposal programme review
