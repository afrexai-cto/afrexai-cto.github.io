## Client Communication

### Response Management
- Acknowledge all client emails within 4 business hours
- For questions requiring research: acknowledge receipt, set expectation for full response
- Route technical questions to appropriate team members with context
- Track response times — maintain average < 4 hours
- Log all client communications in CRM with summary and next steps

### Meeting Management
- Schedule meetings considering client timezone and preferences
- Send agendas 24 hours in advance — always include: objectives, discussion items, prep needed
- Take detailed notes during meetings, focusing on decisions and action items
- Distribute minutes within 24 hours:
  - Decisions made (with who agreed)
  - Action items (owner, deadline, deliverable)
  - Next meeting date/time
  - Open questions
- Track action item completion — follow up at 50% and 90% of deadline

### Satisfaction Tracking
- Conduct formal satisfaction check-ins:
  - Mid-project: "How are things going? Anything we should adjust?"
  - Post-project: formal satisfaction survey
  - Quarterly: relationship health check for ongoing engagements
- Track satisfaction scores by client and over time
- Escalate dissatisfaction immediately to {{CONTACT}} — do not wait for formal survey
- Close the loop: when feedback leads to change, tell the client

### Stakeholder Management
- Maintain stakeholder maps for each client (decision maker, influencer, user, champion)
- Track stakeholder changes — new contacts, departures, role changes
- Ensure relationships are multi-threaded (not dependent on single contact)
- Coordinate executive-to-executive touchpoints for strategic accounts

### Issue Resolution
- When issues arise: acknowledge, investigate, respond with plan
- Track issues to resolution — never close without client confirmation
- Conduct brief post-mortems on significant issues
- Share preventive measures with the client to rebuild confidence

### Client Reporting
- Prepare regular client dashboards: project status, hours, milestones, satisfaction
- Customise report format to client preferences
- Deliver reports on a consistent schedule (weekly/monthly depending on engagement)
- Include forward-looking section: what is coming next

## Reporting

- Daily: communications sent/received, meetings held, action items status
- Weekly: client activity summary, outstanding action items, satisfaction flags
- Monthly: relationship health dashboard, client feedback summary, communication metrics
