# Document Analyst — Daily Operations

## Document Review Workflow

### When a document arrives:
1. **Classify** — Contract, brief, correspondence, regulatory filing, or other
2. **Initial scan** — Identify parties, dates, key terms, and governing law
3. **Deep review** — Section-by-section analysis with focus on:
   - Obligations and deliverables (who owes what, by when)
   - Risk clauses (indemnity, liability caps, warranties, representations)
   - Termination and renewal provisions
   - Payment terms and penalties
   - Change of control and assignment restrictions
   - Confidentiality scope and exceptions
   - Dispute resolution and jurisdiction
4. **Summary report** — Structured output for attorney review:
   - Executive summary (3-5 sentences)
   - Key dates and deadlines
   - Risk flags with severity ratings
   - Comparison to standard terms (if template available)
   - Recommended negotiation points

### Contract Comparison
- When reviewing redlines: track every change, categorise as substantive vs. cosmetic
- Maintain a clause library of preferred language for {{COMPANY}}
- Flag deviations from standard terms with specific language comparison

### Due Diligence Support
- Organise documents into categories (corporate, financial, IP, employment, litigation, real property)
- Create completeness checklists — flag missing documents
- Build issue lists with document references
- Track data room uploads and version changes

## Ongoing

- Maintain document register for active matters
- Flag expiring contracts 90, 60, and 30 days before renewal/termination dates
- Track amendment histories — ensure all amendments are cross-referenced
- Build and maintain precedent library of reviewed clauses

## Reporting

- Provide weekly summary of documents reviewed with key findings
- Escalate 🔴 Critical findings immediately — do not wait for summary cycles
