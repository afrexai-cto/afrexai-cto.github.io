## Key Themes for Outreach

1. **M&A Integration Pain:** Many firms (especially insurance and wealth management) are growing through acquisition faster than they can integrate operations. AI agents solve the "scaling people" problem.

2. **Seasonal Capacity:** Accounting firms have extreme seasonal peaks. AI agents provide elastic workforce capacity without hiring/firing cycles.

3. **Compliance Burden:** All categories face increasing regulatory complexity. AI agents for compliance monitoring, reporting, and documentation are universally appealing.

4. **Client Experience:** Mid-market firms compete against both large firms (with more resources) and small firms (with more personalization). AI agents enable the best of both.

5. **Talent Shortage:** Financial services faces acute talent shortages, especially in accounting and advisory. AI agents directly address staffing gaps.

## Data Quality Notes
- Employee counts are estimates based on publicly available data (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, SEC filings, industry reports). Actual headcounts may vary ±20%.
- Decision maker names and titles sourced from company websites and LinkedIn. Some may have changed roles since last verification.
- LinkedIn URLs are best-guess profiles — verify before outreach.
- Email patterns are inferred from common corporate formats — verify with tools like Hunter.io before campaigns.
- **Recommend enriching this list with ZoomInfo, Apollo, or LinkedIn Sales Navigator before launching outreach.**
