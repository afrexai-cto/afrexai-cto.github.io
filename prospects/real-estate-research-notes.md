# AfrexAI Real Estate Revenue Engine — Brokerage Research Notes

## Research Date: February 14, 2026

## Overview
Compiled a list of 100 mid-sized independent/regional real estate brokerages across Texas (50) and Florida (50), targeting firms with 5-50 agents in high transaction velocity markets. These are potential pilot customers for AI lead qualification tools.

## Market Split

### Texas (50 brokerages)
- **DFW (Dallas/Fort Worth/Plano/Frisco):** ~18 firms
- **Houston:** ~15 firms
- **Austin:** ~10 firms
- **San Antonio:** ~7 firms

### Florida (50 brokerages)
- **Miami/South Florida:** ~17 firms
- **Tampa Bay:** ~13 firms
- **Orlando/Central Florida:** ~12 firms
- **Jacksonville/NE Florida:** ~8 firms

## Key Findings

### 1. Massive AI Chat Gap
**~95% of brokerages researched have NO live chat or AI chat functionality.** This is the single biggest opportunity. Most rely on basic contact forms and phone numbers. Lead response time is likely measured in hours, not seconds.

### 2. Digital Maturity Distribution
- **Score 1 (Very Poor):** ~5% — HTTP-only sites, truly outdated (e.g., Alamo Real Estate Brokers, Mia Realty Corp)
- **Score 2 (Below Average):** ~40% — Template sites, no chat, minimal social, few reviews
- **Score 3 (Average):** ~40% — Decent sites with IDX, some social presence, but no automation
- **Score 4 (Good):** ~15% — Modern sites, strong content/SEO, good reviews, but still no AI tools
- **Score 5 (Excellent):** 0% — No firm had AI-driven lead qualification

### 3. Common Inefficiencies (Ranked by Frequency)
1. **No live chat / AI chat** (95%+)
2. **No visible CRM integration** (~80%)
3. **Basic/template websites** (~45%)
4. **Limited or no social media presence** (~40%)
5. **Few or no Google/Yelp reviews** (~35%)
6. **Poor mobile responsiveness** (~20%)
7. **No content marketing/blog** (~30%)
8. **Manual lead follow-up processes** (estimated ~90%)

### 4. Most Promising Targets (Highest Potential ROI from AI)

#### Texas Top Picks
| Firm | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Monument Realty (Dallas)** | Growing DFW firm, active market, no chat, basic lead capture |
| **Teifke Real Estate (Austin)** | 30 agents, high volume, good site but no AI chat |
| **Spyglass Realty (Austin)** | Boutique luxury, strong reviews, manual follow-up |
| **Brooks & Davis (Houston)** | Growing independent, underserved digital tools |
| **Becker Properties (San Antonio)** | 15 agents, independent since 2009, no automation |

#### Florida Top Picks
| Firm | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Mainframe Real Estate (Orlando)** | Tech-forward brand, #1 independent downtown, ready for AI |
| **Mihara & Associates (Tampa)** | 45 agents, marketing-driven, grown from 7 to 68 agents, needs automation |
| **Palermo Real Estate (Tampa)** | 3rd largest independent in South Tampa, growing market share |
| **CrossView Realty (Jacksonville)** | 33 agents, $500M+ closed, basic digital tools |
| **Blackbook Properties (Miami)** | 20 agents, strong web presence, luxury condo focus |

### 5. Market Dynamics

#### Texas
- **DFW:** Extremely high transaction velocity. Multiple boutique firms competing with major franchises. Independent brokerages are differentiating on service quality and local expertise.
- **Houston:** Massive market with 3,000+ brokerages. The mid-tier independent segment is underserved by technology. HAR.com dominance means many firms rely on the MLS portal rather than their own digital presence.
- **Austin:** Tech-savvy market but boutique brokerages still lack AI tools. Higher digital maturity on average.
- **San Antonio:** More traditional market. Lower digital maturity. Firms like Alamo Real Estate Brokers still running HTTP-only websites.

#### Florida
- **Miami:** International buyer market creates unique lead qualification challenges (language, timezone, investor vs. end-user). AI chat with multilingual capability would be a strong sell.
- **Tampa:** Fast-growing market. Mihara & Associates is a standout example — grew from 7 to 68 agents with marketing focus but still manual processes.
- **Orlando:** Mix of residential and vacation/investment properties. Mainframe Real Estate is the most tech-forward firm identified.
- **Jacksonville:** Military relocation market creates steady demand. Momentum Realty is fastest-growing in NE Florida.

### 6. Outreach Strategy Recommendations

1. **Lead with the chat gap** — Every firm lacks AI chat. Demo an AI chatbot qualifying leads 24/7 on their website.
2. **Target Score 3-4 firms first** — They're digitally mature enough to understand the value but haven't implemented AI yet. Score 1-2 firms may need more education.
3. **Use volume metrics** — "You get X website visitors/month but only Y inquiries. Our AI can 3x that conversion."
4. **Miami angle** — Multilingual AI chat for international buyers is a unique value prop.
5. **Tampa angle** — Fast-growing firms like Mihara need to scale without proportionally scaling staff.
6. **Approach broker/owners directly** — These are small enough firms that the owner makes tech decisions.

### 7. Data Quality Notes

- **Email addresses** are mostly generic info@ addresses derived from websites. Direct broker emails would need LinkedIn/social outreach to confirm.
- **Agent counts** are estimates based on website team pages, Yelp reviews, LinkedIn data, and web mentions. Actual counts may vary ±30%.
- **Monthly listing volumes** are rough estimates based on market activity and firm size. Actual data would require MLS access.
- **Some firms may have grown beyond 50 agents** since last public data (e.g., Mihara grew rapidly).
- **A few firms listed may be franchise affiliates** (e.g., Corcoran Prestige) operating as independent offices — still valid targets as they make their own tech decisions.
