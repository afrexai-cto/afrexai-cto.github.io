# AfrexAI Agent-as-a-Service — Email Templates

## Template 1: Cold Outreach — "We Run AI Employees For You"

**Subject options (A/B):**
- A: "What if you could hire an AI employee tomorrow?"
- B: "We run AI agents so you don't have to"
- C: "[COMPANY] + AI agents — without the headcount"

**Body:**

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Most companies we talk to want AI but don't want another platform to manage. Fair enough.

So we flipped the model: instead of selling you software, we run AI agents *for* you. They show up trained on your workflows, integrated into your tools, and managed by our team.

Think of it as hiring a new employee — except they work 24/7, cost a fraction, and we handle everything from setup to ongoing optimization.

One client went from 12-hour SAR review cycles to under 3 hours. Another cut their outside counsel spend by 40%. No internal AI team required.

We offer two tiers:
- **Single Agent** — one dedicated AI agent for a specific workflow ($1,500/mo)
- **Full Swarm** — multiple agents working together across your operations ($5,000/mo)

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits [COMPANY]?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Template 2: Wizard Follow-Up — "You Started, Let's Finish"

**Subject options:**
- A: "Your AI agent is almost ready"
- B: "Quick follow-up on your AfrexAI setup"

**Body:**

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

You recently started setting up an AI agent through our wizard — nice! That tells me you're thinking seriously about automating [WORKFLOW_AREA].

A lot of people get to that stage and then hit the "who's going to manage this?" wall. That's exactly what we solve.

With our Managed Agent service, we take it from here:
- We finish the setup based on your inputs
- We deploy, monitor, and optimize the agent
- You just see the results

No engineering time on your end. No ongoing tinkering.

Want us to pick up where you left off? Happy to jump on a quick call.

## Template 3: Existing Contact Re-Engage — "Things Have Changed"

**Subject options:**
- A: "We changed our model — thought you'd want to know"
- B: "Remember AfrexAI? We're doing something different now"

**Body:**

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

We talked [TIMEFRAME] ago about [PREVIOUS_TOPIC]. Since then, we've made a big shift.

Instead of selling AI consulting projects, we now run managed AI agents as a service. You subscribe, we deploy agents that handle real work — compliance monitoring, document review, customer operations, whatever your bottleneck is.

Why the change? Because our clients didn't want another project. They wanted ongoing results without managing AI themselves.

Two options:
- **Single Agent** — $1,500/mo for one dedicated workflow
- **Full Swarm** — $5,000/mo for multi-agent operations

It's a fundamentally different offer from what we discussed before. Worth revisiting?
