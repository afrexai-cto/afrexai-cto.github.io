Hi Sean,

Wanted to make sure my last email landed — I know inboxes get crazy, especially in real estate.

Quick recap: you downloaded configs for 8 automation areas through our setup wizard. We can have your first agent running within a week — most of our clients start with Lead Outreach or Prospect Research since those tend to pay for themselves fastest.

Happy to walk you through it on a quick call. No pitch, just showing you what the setup actually looks like for a brokerage your size.

Here's my calendar: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Talk soon,

Christina Beckford  
CEO, AfrexAI
