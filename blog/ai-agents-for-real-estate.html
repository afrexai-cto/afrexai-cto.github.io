<h1>AI Agents for Real Estate</h1>

<p>The average real estate agent responds to a new lead in 47 hours. The ones who respond in under 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert. You already know this. But you're juggling showings, contracts, and that seller who calls you six times a day about their Zestimate.</p>

<p>AI agents handle the speed-to-lead problem — and about a dozen other things eating your commission.</p>

<h2>Where Real Estate Businesses Bleed Time</h2>

<p><strong>Lead response and qualification.</strong> A new Zillow lead comes in at 11pm. Your agent responds in under 60 seconds. Not with a canned auto-reply — with an actual conversation. It qualifies budget, timeline, pre-approval status, and neighborhood preferences. By morning, you've got a warm lead with notes instead of a cold one you forgot about.</p>

<p><strong>Transaction coordination.</strong> The average residential deal has 150+ tasks between accepted offer and closing. Inspection deadlines, appraisal scheduling, title requests, lender follow-ups. Agents track every milestone, send reminders to the right parties, and flag anything falling behind. Your TC handles 3x the volume without burning out.</p>

<p><strong>Listing management.</strong> Agents draft descriptions from MLS data and photos, syndicate across platforms, monitor days on market, and suggest price adjustments based on comp activity. They don't replace your market knowledge — they do the grunt work around it.</p>

<p><strong>Client nurture campaigns.</strong> That database of 2,000 past clients and leads? Agents run personalized drip campaigns based on life events, market conditions in their zip code, and engagement patterns. Not generic newsletters. Actual relevant touchpoints.</p>

<p><strong>Showing feedback collection.</strong> After every showing, agents reach out to buyer's agents for feedback. Automatically. No more chasing people who ghosted you three showings ago. Results compiled into a report for your seller within 24 hours.</p>

<h2>The Money</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lead response time drops from hours to under 2 minutes</li>
<li>Conversion rate on inbound leads increases 30-40% from speed alone</li>
<li>Transaction coordinators handle 25-30 files simultaneously instead of 10-12</li>
<li>Agent teams reclaim 15-20 hours/week currently spent on admin</li>
<li>On a team closing 10 deals/month at $8,000 average commission, a 20% conversion lift is an extra $192,000/year</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reality Check</h2>

<p>AI agents won't preview a house, negotiate a counteroffer, or calm down a first-time buyer having a panic attack at the inspection. But they handle the communication loops, deadline tracking, and lead nurture that eat up 60% of your day. You focus on relationships and closing. They focus on everything else.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>$1,500/month for a single agent — lead qualification, transaction coordination, or nurture campaigns. $5,000/month for a full swarm covering your entire pipeline from first inquiry to post-close follow-up. That's less than one deal's commission running your back office 24/7.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>We deploy within 7 days. Your CRM stays. Your MLS tools stay. Follow Up Boss, KVCore, Salesforce, BoomTown — doesn't matter. Agents plug into what you already use.</p>
