<h1>The <span>$1.6M Revenue Leak</span>: How a Law Firm Recovered What They Didn't Know They Were Losing</h1>

<!-- TODO: Replace VIDEO_ID with actual ID for "This Law Firm Recovered $1.6M with AI Case Analysis" from @AfrexAI -->

<p>VADIS is a mid-size law firm with 45 employees. They specialize in corporate litigation, regulatory compliance, and commercial contracts. By all outward appearances, they were doing fine — steady revenue, growing client base, good reputation.</p>

<p>But they had a problem they couldn't see.</p>

<h2>The Discovery</h2>

<p>When VADIS came to us, they weren't looking for AI. They were looking for help with "operational efficiency" — a polite way of saying their team was drowning. Attorneys were spending 15+ hours a week on admin. Billing was always late. Collections were inconsistent. Compliance deadlines were tracked in spreadsheets that nobody trusted.</p>

<p>We ran a PIA audit — our Pain, Impact, Architect framework. The goal: find the cracks, quantify what they cost, then design the fix.</p>

<p>What we found shocked everyone.</p>

<div class="stat-block">
<div class="stat"><span class="num">$1.6M</span><span class="lbl">Annual Revenue Leaked</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="num">3,200+</span><span class="lbl">Unbilled Hours per Year</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="num">$340K</span><span class="lbl">In Uncollected AR</span></div>
</div>

<h2>Where the Money Was Going</h2>

<p><strong>Unbilled hours — $890K.</strong> Attorneys were consistently under-reporting time. Quick phone calls, email reviews, document scans — work that took 10-20 minutes each but happened dozens of times daily. Nobody was logging it. The billing agent found discrepancies between calendar entries, email timestamps, and logged time that totaled over 3,200 hours per year.</p>

<p><strong>Late and missed collections — $340K.</strong> The firm had a receivables problem nobody was actively managing. Invoices went 60, 90, 120 days without follow-up. Not because they didn't care — because no one owned the process. It was "everyone's job," which meant it was no one's job.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance gaps — $210K in risk exposure.</strong> Regulatory deadlines tracked in Google Sheets with manual reminders. Three near-misses in the previous year alone. The potential fines and malpractice exposure totaled over $210K.</p>

<p><strong>Admin overhead — $160K.</strong> Senior attorneys spending 15+ hours per week on scheduling, document management, and inbox triage. At their billing rate, that time had a direct opportunity cost of $160K annually.</p>

<h2>The Fix</h2>

<p>We deployed four AI agents:</p>

<p><strong>Billing Agent:</strong> Integrated with Clio, Gmail, and Outlook calendars. Cross-references all attorney activity with logged time entries. Flags discrepancies daily. Generates draft invoices weekly. Result: unbilled hours dropped 91% in the first month.</p>

<p><strong>Collections Agent:</strong> Took over the entire AR follow-up process. Sends personalized payment reminders at 30, 45, 60, and 75 days. Escalates to partners at 90. Maintains a professional, firm tone. Result: 87% of overdue invoices collected within 60 days.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance Monitor:</strong> Tracks all regulatory deadlines, court filings, and license renewals. Sends alerts 30, 14, and 7 days before deadlines. Generates compliance checklists automatically. Result: zero near-misses since deployment.</p>

<p><strong>Executive Assistant:</strong> Handles inbox triage, scheduling, and meeting prep for senior attorneys. Categorizes emails, drafts responses, books meetings, and prepares briefing docs. Result: attorneys reclaimed 12+ hours per week.</p>

<div class="highlight"><p>"I knew we were leaving some money on the table. I didn't know it was $1.6 million. The agents paid for themselves in the first two weeks." — Managing Partner, VADIS</p></div>

<h2>The Results — 6 Months Later</h2>

<p>Six months after deployment:</p>
<ul style="margin:0 0 1.5rem 1.5rem;color:#aaa">
<li><strong>$1.6M</strong> in annualized recovered revenue</li>
<li><strong>91%</strong> reduction in unbilled hours</li>
<li><strong>87%</strong> collection rate on previously overdue accounts</li>
<li><strong>Zero</strong> compliance near-misses</li>
<li><strong>12 hours/week</strong> reclaimed per senior attorney</li>
<li><strong>ROI positive</strong> in 14 days</li>
</ul>

<p>The agents now run 24/7 as permanent members of the VADIS team. They have their own email addresses. Clients interact with them directly for billing inquiries. The firm treats them like any other employee — except they work around the clock and cost a fraction of a junior hire.</p>

<h2>The Lesson</h2>

<p>VADIS wasn't a failing firm. They were a successful firm with invisible leaks. And that's the thing — most businesses don't know how much they're losing because the losses are spread across hundreds of small moments every day. A 10-minute call that doesn't get billed. An invoice that doesn't get followed up. A deadline that almost gets missed.</p>

<p>Those small moments add up to $1.6M.</p>

<p>How much is your business leaking?</p>
