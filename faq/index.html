<p class="section-tag">FAQ</p>
<h1>Everything you need to know about <span>AI agents</span></h1>
<p>Straight answers to the questions we hear most. No jargon, no fluff.</p>
</div>
</div>

<section>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<div class="faq-item open">
<h3>What exactly is an "AI agent workforce"?</h3>
<p>Think of AI agents as digital employees that handle specific tasks autonomously. Unlike chatbots that just answer questions, agents actually do work — they process documents, send follow-ups, reconcile data, coordinate between systems, and make routine decisions. They run 24/7, don't take sick days, and cost a fraction of a human employee.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How is this different from ChatGPT or other AI tools?</h3>
<p>ChatGPT is a conversation tool — you ask it things and it responds. AI agents are autonomous workers that take actions in your business systems. They connect to your CRM, email, accounting software, and databases. They don't wait for prompts — they monitor, execute, and report. It's the difference between asking someone a question and hiring someone to do the job.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How long does it take to get started?</h3>
<p>Our "Week I Win" guarantee means you see a working AI agent demo in 7 days. Full deployment typically takes 2-4 weeks depending on complexity. Compare that to 6-18 months with traditional consulting firms. We start with the highest-ROI workflow and expand from there.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What if it doesn't work for my business?</h3>
<p>We offer a "$40K Recovery" guarantee — if our AI agents don't save or generate at least $40,000 in value within 90 days, we keep working until they do. We also start with a discovery call to make sure there's a genuine fit before either side commits.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pricing & Investment</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p>Full AI agent deployments range from $120,000 to $250,000+ depending on scope and industry. This is a fraction of what consulting firms charge ($500K-$5M) and includes ongoing maintenance. We also offer entry-level packages starting at lower price points for specific use cases. Book a call and we'll give you exact pricing for your situation.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What's the ROI timeline?</h3>
<p>Most clients see positive ROI within 30-90 days. The first agent typically pays for itself within the first month through time savings, error reduction, or revenue recovery. We build a custom ROI model during your free audit so you know the expected returns before committing.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Is there a monthly fee after deployment?</h3>
<p>Yes — AI agents require ongoing maintenance, monitoring, and optimization. Think of it like the salary of a digital employee, except it's a fraction of what a human would cost. Maintenance plans start at $1,500/month and include updates, support, and continuous improvement.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Security & Compliance</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Is my data safe?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Agents operate within your existing infrastructure — we don't move your data to our servers. We follow SOC 2 principles, and for regulated industries (healthcare, financial services, legal), we build compliance directly into agent workflows.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do AI agents have access to everything?</h3>
<p>No. We implement principle of least privilege — each agent only accesses the specific systems and data it needs to do its job. You approve all integrations, and everything is auditable. You can revoke access at any time.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What about HIPAA / SOX / GDPR compliance?</h3>
<p>We build compliance into the agent architecture from day one. For healthcare (HIPAA), we ensure PHI handling follows required safeguards. For financial services (SOX), we maintain audit trails and access controls. For any business handling EU data (GDPR), we implement data minimization and right-to-deletion capabilities.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What systems do AI agents integrate with?</h3>
<p>We integrate with virtually any business system that has an API or accepts email — CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), accounting (QuickBooks, Xero), practice management (Clio, PracticePanther), property management (AppFolio, Buildium), EHRs, ERPs, and more. If your system has an API, we can connect to it.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do I need to change my existing software?</h3>
<p>No. AI agents work alongside your existing tools — they don't replace them. Think of them as a new team member that already knows how to use all your software. No migration, no retraining your staff on new systems.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What happens when an agent doesn't know what to do?</h3>
<p>Agents are built with clear escalation paths. When they encounter something outside their training — an unusual edge case, an ambiguous request, or a high-stakes decision — they escalate to a human with full context. Over time, they learn from these escalations and handle more autonomously.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Can I see what the agents are doing?</h3>
<p>Yes. Every agent action is logged and auditable. We provide dashboards showing what each agent processed, decisions it made, and outcomes. Full transparency — these agents work for you, not the other way around.</p>
</div>

<h2>Working With AfrexAI</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What industries do you serve?</h3>
<p>We specialize in law firms, financial services, healthcare, construction, accounting, real estate, insurance, and marketing agencies. But our agent architecture works for any industry with repeatable workflows. Book a call and we'll tell you honestly whether we're a fit.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How big does my company need to be?</h3>
<p>Our sweet spot is companies doing $5M-$500M in revenue. You need enough process volume to justify automation and enough budget to invest in it properly. If you're doing under $5M, our self-serve AI context packs and tools may be a better starting point.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Will AI agents replace my employees?</h3>
<p>No — they augment them. AI agents handle the repetitive, low-value tasks that burn out your best people. Your employees get to focus on work that requires human judgment, creativity, and relationships. Companies using AI agents typically don't reduce headcount — they increase capacity and revenue without hiring.</p>
