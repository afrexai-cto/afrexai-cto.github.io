4. **PLAYBOOK updated** — New contacts, Legalweek targets, action items checked off.

**Key intel:** Baker Donelson named "Distinguished in Innovation" by BTI 2025. They have strict AI policies (no public tools for client work) — perfect angle: "We deploy private, managed agents that comply with your AI policy."

**Expected impact:**
- Legalweek outreach to 7 innovation leaders = potential 3-5 meetings at event (pipeline: $500K-$2M)

2. **Valentine's Day LinkedIn post drafted** — "Liberation not automation" angle. Hooks Valentine's Day theme into employee retention + AI agents removing drudge work. Emotional, not salesy. Saved: `content/linkedin/valentines-day-ai-post.md`

3. **Shook Hardy intel** — Key insight: They hired their first 2 data scientists in 2020, actively exploring AI efficiencies. Product liability focus = massive document review workload. Perfect fit for contract/doc review agents. 8 Chambers USA 2025 rankings, 207 trials in 10 years = high-volume litigation shop.

4. **PLAYBOOK updated** — New contacts + action items checked off.

**Expected impact:**
- Valentine's Day post = timely, high-engagement potential (emotional hooks outperform tactical on weekends)

Saved: `content/private-ai-agents-positioning.md`

Bill Finner promoted to CIO same time. Both added to PLAYBOOK. Jackson Walker = Am Law 109, $454M rev, Texas/energy focus.

3. **PLAYBOOK updated** — New contacts, action items checked off.

**Key intel:** Jackson Walker creating a brand new CINO role in Aug 2025 signals they're actively investing in legal tech innovation. Greg Lambert came from Chief Knowledge Services — he understands workflows, not just IT. Perfect target for "Your AI Workforce, Managed" pitch.

Added to PLAYBOOK.

Covers thought leadership, case studies, industry insight, data posts, behind-the-scenes, contrarian takes. All US-audience optimized (7-9 AM EST). Saved: `content/linkedin/february-content-calendar.md`

4. **PLAYBOOK updated** — 2 new verified contacts (13 total across 11 firms), enriched target table with merger info + key personnel.

**Key intel:**
- HSF Kramer merger creates a unique window — Logvinova is building AI strategy for a newly combined global firm. She needs implementation partners, not more consultants. Her McKinsey background means she'll respond to ROI-driven pitches, not hype.
- Lowenstein Sandler's VC/tech practice makes them natural buyers — they understand AI value from advising tech companies.

**Expected impact:**
- LinkedIn calendar gives Christina 2 weeks of ready-to-post content (6 posts)

   - **UiPath acquired WorkFusion** (Feb 10) = vendor transition window for compliance customers
   - **Fintech Risk & Compliance Forum** = conference sponsorship opportunity for Christina
   - First named prospect: Cris Mattoon (Michigan First CU, CRO/CCO)

3. **Playbook insight added** — Colorado compliance law creates urgency angle for cold outreach

**Expected impact:**
- Wednesday LinkedIn post continues content cadence (3 posts/week target)
- Colorado SB 24-205 angle gives cold emails a REAL regulatory trigger (not generic "AI is coming")
- WorkFusion acquisition creates 50-100 potential prospects in vendor transition

All use AI in financial decisions = directly in scope of Colorado AI Act (SB 24-205). Added to `research/finserv-prospect-targets.md` as Tier 3.

2. **Colorado AI Act deadline corrected** — Enforcement pushed to June 30, 2026 (was Feb 1). Updated PLAYBOOK.md. This is BETTER for us: companies now have 4.5 months and know it's real = budget allocation window.

3. **Competitive intel gathered** — WorkFusion positions as "AI Agents for Financial Crime Compliance" (exact same language as us). Their case studies show $1M-$4.2M savings per bank. This validates our pricing ($200K-$500K ACV is a bargain vs what they're paying WorkFusion).

**Expected impact:**

These events are EXACTLY where our buyers congregate — BSA Officers, CCOs, compliance leaders. Speaking slot application recommended. Total minimum conference budget: $5,500. Saved to `research/conference-opportunities.md`.

3. **Podcast guest strategy outlined** — 2-3 free podcast appearances before September ACAMS to build Christina's authority on AI agents in compliance. Zero cost, high ROI.

Saved to `research/prospects/legal-firm-targets-10.md`.

3. **Playbook updated** — Anni Datesh entry corrected (Wilson Sonsini, Legalweek speaker), new action items checked off, consolidated timestamp updated.

**Expected impact:**

- 10 named legal contacts with warm signals (conference speakers, recent AI hires, published AI advocates) = higher response rates than cold lists. Top 5 are "warm" — Ilona Logvinova (HSF Kramer) and Anni Datesh (Wilson Sonsini) are highest priority.
- **All 3 high-value verticals now have complete email sequences ready for deployment.** Combined pipeline potential: 6-9 meetings/month from 2,000 sends = 2-3 deals = $400K-$750K ARR per month.

Saved to `research/prospects/healthcare-system-targets-10.md`.

2. **Personalized outreach email drafted for Ilona Logvinova** — #1 priority legal target. Chief AI Officer at HSF Kramer, appointed Nov 2025, ex-McKinsey + ex-Mastercard. Building AI strategy from scratch post-merger = no incumbent to displace. Email positions Christina as peer advisor, not vendor. Saved to `content/personalized-emails/ilona-logvinova-hsf-kramer.md`.

3. **Healthcare AI intel gathered** — Key insight from Becker's: "CIOs stepping away from experimentation toward disciplined, scalable deployment in 2026." This is EXACTLY our positioning — we're the implementation partner that makes pilots into production. Jackson Health already proved AI ROI on appointment rescheduling (reduced no-shows, freed FTEs).

**Expected impact:**
- 10 named healthcare contacts with warm signals = ready for email sequence deployment. Healthcare ACV $200K-$500K. Top 5 are "publicly AI-positive" = higher response rates.
- Ilona Logvinova email could unlock HSF Kramer ($500K+ ACV Strategic tier). She's 3 months into role, actively sourcing partners. Timing is perfect.
- All 3 verticals now have: complete email sequences + named prospect lists. Total addressable pipeline: 30+ named contacts across finserv, legal, healthcare.

**Next run priorities:**

3. **Becker's Hospital Review submission researched** — No public submission guidelines found (page 404'd). Contact email: becker@beckershealthcare.com. Strategy: pitch a contributed article on "Why 95% of Healthcare AI Pilots Fail — And What the 5% Do Differently." Positions AfrexAI as thought leader without being salesy. Need Christina to send pitch email.

**Expected impact:**
- Jim Roeder email = potential $200K-$350K deal. Rural mid-market = fastest close cycle (no 12-person committee). If he bites, could close in 60-90 days.
- Healthcare one-pager = essential sales collateral for ALL healthcare outreach. Every email sequence can now attach this. Professional credibility multiplier.
- Becker's article = 500K+ monthly readers. One published article = inbound leads for months. Healthcare CIOs read Becker's religiously.

Saved to `content/sales-materials/legal-one-pager.md`.

2. **Becker's Hospital Review pitch email drafted for Christina** — ready-to-send contributed article pitch. Title: "Why 95% of Healthcare AI Pilots Fail — And What the 5% Do Differently." Humanized tone, no AI-speak, positioned as practical not salesy. Saved to `content/personalized-emails/beckers-pitch-christina.md`.

**Expected impact:**
- Legal one-pager = essential collateral for ALL legal outreach. Every legal email sequence can now attach this. Legal has 2-4 month sales cycle (fastest vertical). 10-15 large firm deals at $500K+ = significant ARR chunk.
- Becker's pitch = 500K+ monthly readers. One published article generates inbound for months. Healthcare CIOs read Becker's religiously. If accepted, this is the highest-leverage content play available.

Saved to `content/sales-materials/finserv-one-pager.md`.

2. **LinkedIn post drafted — "Why 95% of Legal AI Pilots Fail"** — thought leadership content for AfrexAI company page. Addresses 3 specific mistakes law firms make, positions AfrexAI as the implementation partner. Humanized tone, no AI-speak, ends with clear CTA. Saved to `content/linkedin-posts/2026-02-14-legal-ai-failures.md`.

3. **Finserv conference research — Money20/20 2026 dates confirmed:**
   - Money20/20 Asia: Apr 21-23, Bangkok
   - Money20/20 Europe: Jun 2-4, Amsterdam (closest/cheapest for UK-based team)
   - Money20/20 USA: Oct 18-21, Las Vegas (the big one)
   - Money20/20 Middle East: Sep 14-16, Riyadh
   - **Recommendation:** Europe (June) is the near-term play — 3.5 months out, Amsterdam flight is cheap from Manchester. Apply for startup exhibitor/pitch competition. USA (October) for serious pipeline if revenue justifies travel.

**Expected impact:**
- Finserv one-pager = every finserv email sequence can now attach professional collateral. Finserv is the #1 vertical by AI consulting spend (22.3%). ACV $200K-$1M.
- LinkedIn post = organic reach to legal decision-makers. If it performs well (500+ impressions), boost with $50. One viral legal post can generate 3-5 inbound leads.
- Conference intel = Money20/20 Europe in June is the best near-term opportunity to network with finserv buyers. Early bird pricing likely available now.
- **All 3 verticals now have: email sequences + named prospects + one-pagers + LinkedIn content. Sales infrastructure is COMPLETE.**

ROI table, phased pricing, next steps. Saved to `content/sales-materials/proposal-template.md`. Now all 3 verticals have: one-pagers + email sequences + proposal template.

2. **Colorado SB 24-205 email sequence created** — 4-email cold outreach sequence targeting Colorado fintech CCOs/CROs facing June 30 enforcement deadline. Urgency-driven (4.5 months left), positions compliance as competitive advantage not cost center. From Christina Beckford (brand face). Saved to `content/email-sequences/colorado-sb205-sequence.md`.

3. **6 new Colorado fintech prospects added** — researched Built In Colorado + fintech reports. Added Homebot, Enova International, Inspira Financial, Moov Financial, Zest AI, and Scienaptic AI to Tier 3 prospect list. All use AI in financial decisions = directly affected by SB 24-205. Enova alone has $67B+ in loans originated using ML underwriting.

**Expected impact:**
- Proposal template = any discovery call can now convert to a professional, branded proposal within hours. Removes a major sales friction point.
- SB 24-205 sequence = time-sensitive hook (June 30 deadline) creates genuine urgency. Colorado fintechs MUST comply. This isn't theoretical — it's regulatory pressure. 4-email sequence with clear escalation and breakup pattern.
- 6 new prospects = expands finserv pipeline to 10 named companies. Enova (NYSE: ENVA) is a $2B+ public company using ML in lending. Even a small engagement = $200K+.
- **Key insight**: Zest AI is interesting as both prospect AND potential partner — they build AI lending models, their CLIENTS need compliance help. Could be a referral channel.

- Draft LinkedIn post about Colorado SB 24-205 (thought leadership + lead gen)
- Research Homebot and Enova leadership (find CCO/compliance contacts)

### Run: 2026-02-14 20:56 GMT (Run 32)

**Actions taken:**

No AI-speak, specific mistakes companies are making, clear CTA. Saved to `content/linkedin-posts/2026-02-14-colorado-sb205-compliance.md`. This complements the legal AI failures post — now we have vertical-specific content for both legal AND finserv.

2. **2 new high-value prospect contacts researched and added:**
   - **Enova International** (NYSE: ENVA, ~$1.6B revenue): Sean Rahilly, GC & CCO since 2013. $67B+ in ML-underwritten loans = directly in scope for SB 24-205. Leadership transition (CEO departing Jul 2025) = budget reset, openness to new vendors. Even a small engagement = $200K+.
   - **Homebot** (Denver, 83 employees): Charlie Pratt (CEO), Ira McMahon (CTO/Co-Founder). Denver-based fintech using AI for homeowner recommendations = "consequential decisions" under SB 24-205. Small enough to close fast (2-4 week cycle).

3. **Money20/20 Europe intel gathered:** Jun 2-4, Amsterdam. VIP passes ~€3,000+, startup discounts reportedly 50% off. 1 in 3 attendees are C-Suite. 2,300+ exhibitors. **Recommendation: apply for startup exhibitor program ASAP — early bird pricing likely still available for 3.5 months out.**

**Expected impact:**
- SB 24-205 LinkedIn post = positions AfrexAI as THE compliance partner for Colorado fintechs. June 30 deadline creates genuine urgency — this isn't theoretical, it's regulatory. Could drive 2-5 inbound inquiries if boosted.
- Enova prospect = potential $200K-$500K engagement. Public company, ML-heavy lending, CCO identified by name. SB 24-205 sequence is ready to deploy.
- Homebot prospect = fast-close opportunity ($50K-$100K). Denver-based, small team, directly affected by Colorado law.
- **Finserv pipeline now has 8+ named contacts across Raymond James, Valley Bank, Enova, Homebot, Moov, Zest AI, Scienaptic, Inspira.**

2. **4 podcast guest opportunities identified** — Emerj "AI in Financial Services" (has guest application form at emerj.com/e2), Compliance Podcast Network (daily AI compliance show), "What the Fraud?" by Sumsub, and "AI in Banking & Finance". All accept guest pitches. Added to `conference-opportunities.md` with pitch template.

3. **Playbook reviewed** — no new research files to consolidate since Run 32. All insights current.

**Expected impact:**
- Enova email ($200K-$500K potential) + Homebot email ($50K-$100K potential) = $250K-$600K pipeline if both convert. SB 24-205 deadline creates genuine urgency.
- Podcast appearances = free thought leadership reaching compliance decision-makers. Emerj specifically targets financial services executives — exactly our ICP. 1 podcast appearance could drive 5-10 qualified inbound leads.

**Next run priorities:**
- Draft podcast pitch email for Emerj (emerj.com/e2 application)

3. **Playbook updated with HHS April 3, 2026 deadline** — New regulatory mandate requiring all HHS divisions to adopt AI governance practices. Added to Healthcare vertical section. Also added HFMA trend: healthcare orgs creating "Chief AI Implementation Officer" roles — these are warm targets who need quick wins.

4. **Healthcare regulatory intel gathered** — HHS AI governance deadline (April 3, 2026) creates urgency similar to Colorado SB 24-205 for finserv. Healthcare systems that use AI for clinical decisions, documentation, or claims must have governance frameworks by then.

**Expected impact:**
- Emerj podcast = 5-10 qualified inbound leads from financial services executives. Zero cost marketing.
- Compliance Readiness Assessment = evergreen lead magnet. Can be turned into interactive web tool, gated PDF, or LinkedIn carousel. Drives consultation bookings.

## 2026-02-14 23:56 GMT — Run #14
**Actions taken:**
1. **Competitive intel update** — Added McKinsey 25K agents story (Business Insider, Feb 13) and Chargebee AI pricing playbook to competitive-analysis.md. Key insight: Big 4 validating market but creating hype confusion. AfrexAI's "quality over quantity" positioning is the antidote.
2. **LinkedIn post drafted** — Timely post leveraging McKinsey/EY/PwC agent count debate. Positions AfrexAI as quality alternative. Saved to `content/linkedin-posts/2026-02-15-mckinsey-25k-agents.md`. Ready for Christina to post on company page.
3. **Pricing intel gathered** — Market shifting to outcome-based/hybrid pricing. Our tiered ACV model is ahead of curve. Noted opportunity to add explicit "pay for results" guarantee tier.

**Expected impact:**
- LinkedIn post rides a hot news cycle (1 day old) — higher engagement likely. Could generate 5-15 profile visits from target personas.
- Competitive analysis now includes Big 4 positioning — useful for sales calls ("Even McKinsey's rivals say quantity doesn't matter").
- Pricing insight validates our $140K-$800K tiered approach vs per-seat/per-action models dying in market.

**Next run priorities:**
- Draft a blog post expanding the "3 agents vs 25,000" thesis (SEO target: "AI agent implementation")
- Research Neurons Lab (Top 8 AI Consulting for FSIs article) — potential competitor or partner
- Draft week-ahead content calendar

## 2026-02-15 00:56 GMT — Run #15
**Actions taken:**
1. **Blog post written** — "Why 3 AI Agents Beat 25,000 Every Time" saved to `content/blog-3-agents-vs-25000.md`. 700+ words, SEO-targeted for "AI agent implementation", "AI agent ROI". Uses McKinsey 25K news hook, positions AfrexAI's quality-over-quantity approach. Ready for website/LinkedIn/Medium.
2. **Neurons Lab competitive analysis** — Researched and added to competitive-analysis.md. Key finding: they're AI-exclusive FSI specialists (Visa, AXA, SMFG clients), AWS Advanced Tier partner, heavy content/SEO play. Closest competitor to AfrexAI's positioning but traditional consultancy model vs our managed agents model.
3. **SEO opportunity identified** — Neurons Lab dominates broad FSI AI keywords. AfrexAI should target long-tail: "AI agent for KYC automation", "managed AI compliance agent", "AI agent contract review". These have buyer intent and less competition.

**Expected impact:**
- Blog post can be repurposed into: LinkedIn article (Christina), Medium post, email newsletter content, and 3-4 social media excerpts. The McKinsey news hook is still fresh — high engagement potential.
- Competitive intel on Neurons Lab sharpens positioning: we don't compete on consulting hours, we compete on managed outcomes. This distinction should appear in all sales materials.
- SEO long-tail strategy could drive 50-200 organic visits/month within 3-6 months per keyword.

**Next run priorities:**
- Draft healthcare cold email using HHS April 3 deadline angle
- Create week-ahead content calendar from existing drafts

**Expected impact:**
- Healthcare email sequence targets $350K-$550K ACV prospects. Even 1 reply from 4 contacts = potential $400K+ deal pipeline.
- Content calendar ensures consistent publishing cadence — critical for SEO and LinkedIn algorithm favor. 5 posts/week should generate 50-100+ profile visits.
- Monday is ready to go: 2 pieces queued, just needs Christina to post.
