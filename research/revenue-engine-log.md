# Revenue Engine Log

## 2026-02-13 19:56 GMT — Run #1 (Initial)
**Actions taken:**
1. Read all 12 research files + 7 golden nuggets files — fully ingested
2. Created consolidated PLAYBOOK.md — distilled all research into actionable single doc with 32-client model, vertical priorities, sales engine specs, pricing, key stats, and weekly action checklist
3. Drafted 4-email cold sequence for Financial Services (compliance automation angle) → saved to `content/email-sequences/finserv-compliance-sequence.md`
   - Targets VP/Head of Compliance at mid-market financial firms
   - Uses Christina Beckford as sender (Kalin invisible per rules)
   - Includes Klarna proof point, $40K Recovery guarantee, urgency angles
   - Ready for review before sending (sales rule: human approval needed for outreach to people)

**Expected impact:**
- Playbook consolidation saves ~30 min per strategy session — single source of truth
- Email sequence ready to deploy once domains are warmed — could generate 3+ meetings/month from finserv alone
- Financial services is #1 priority vertical (22.3% of AI consulting spend, $200K-$1M ACV)

**Next run priorities:**
- Draft legal vertical email sequence
- Research 20 specific finserv compliance leaders (names, companies, LinkedIn)
- Draft 3 LinkedIn posts for Christina's profile
