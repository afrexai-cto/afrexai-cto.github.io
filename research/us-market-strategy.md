# AfrexAI — US Market Entry Strategy

**Date:** 13 February 2026  
**Purpose:** Go-to-market playbook for entering the US mid-market with AI services

---

## 1. Best US Cities/Regions for Selling AI Services to Mid-Market

### Tier 1 — High Density of AI Buyers (Start Here)
| City/Region | Why | Key Industries |
|---|---|---|
| **New York City** | Largest concentration of mid-market firms; finance, media, professional services | Financial services, legal, media, healthcare |
| **San Francisco / Bay Area** | AI epicentre; buyers are sophisticated and willing to pay premium | Tech, healthcare, enterprise SaaS |
| **Chicago** | Massive mid-market base; less saturated than coasts; Fortune 500 HQs | Manufacturing, finance, logistics, insurance |
| **Boston** | Healthcare/pharma/biotech corridor; strong enterprise buyers | Healthcare, pharma, education, fintech |

### Tier 2 — High Growth, Lower Competition
| City/Region | Why | Key Industries |
|---|---|---|
| **Austin, TX** | Fast-growing tech hub; cost-conscious mid-market; no state income tax | Tech, enterprise software, semiconductors |
| **Atlanta, GA** | Southeast hub; logistics, fintech, telecom; large Black professional network (cultural alignment for AfrexAI) | Fintech, logistics, telecom, healthcare |
| **Seattle, WA** | Cloud/enterprise AI adoption leaders (Microsoft, Amazon ecosystem) | Cloud, cybersecurity, enterprise |
| **Research Triangle, NC** | Academic density; pharma; growing mid-market tech | Pharma, biotech, SaaS |
| **Dallas-Fort Worth, TX** | Corporate relocations; energy; financial services | Energy, finance, telecom |

### Recommended Entry Sequence
1. **Start with NYC + Chicago** — largest mid-market pools, timezone overlap with UK (EST = GMT-5)
2. **Expand to Atlanta + Austin** — lower cost, high growth, less competition from incumbent AI consultancies
3. **Layer in SF/Boston** only for enterprise/healthcare verticals

## 2. US Buying Behaviour for AI/Tech Services

### How US Mid-Market Companies Buy AI Services

**Key differences from UK:**
- **More aggressive procurement** — US buyers are faster to evaluate but demand more proof (case studies, ROI calculators, references)
- **Bigger buying committees** — Average 6-10 stakeholders involved (vs 3-5 in UK)
- **Champion + Economic Buyer model** — You need an internal champion (usually Director/VP level) AND the economic buyer (CFO/CIO)
- **Proof-of-concept culture** — US buyers expect a paid pilot/POC before committing to a large deal
- **Annual budget cycles** — Most budgets set Q4 for following year; best time to sell is Q1-Q2

### Decision Makers by Company Size

| Company Size | Primary Buyer | Influencers | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| 50-200 employees | CEO/COO | Head of Engineering, VP Ops | CFO |
| 200-1000 employees | CTO/CIO | VP Engineering, Line-of-business leaders | Procurement, Legal, CISO |
| 1000-5000 employees | CIO/CDO (Chief Digital Officer) | IT Directors, Business Unit heads | Procurement, Legal, Security team |

### The US Sales Process (Typical Timeline: 3-9 months)
1. **Awareness** — Content, events, LinkedIn, referrals
2. **Discovery call** (Week 1-2) — 30-min call; qualify budget, authority, need, timeline (BANT)
3. **Demo/workshop** (Week 2-4) — Show the product; ideally tailored to their industry
4. **Technical evaluation** (Week 4-8) — Security questionnaire, architecture review, integration assessment
5. **Paid pilot/POC** (Week 8-16) — $10K-$50K engagement to prove value on real data
6. **Business case / ROI presentation** (Week 16-20) — Champion presents to economic buyer
7. **Procurement/Legal** (Week 20-30) — MSA negotiation, security review, vendor onboarding
8. **Close** — Often tied to budget cycle or quarterly targets

### What US Buyers Care About (Ranked)
1. **ROI / measurable business impact** (not technology for technology's sake)
2. **Security & compliance** (SOC 2, data residency)
3. **References from similar companies** (social proof is king)
4. **Speed to value** (how fast can we see results?)
5. **Integration with existing stack** (Salesforce, Microsoft, AWS)
6. **Vendor stability** (will you be around in 3 years?)

## 3. Legal & Compliance Requirements

### Must-Have Certifications/Frameworks

| Certification | What It Is | Who Requires It | Timeline to Get | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SOC 2 Type II** | Security audit (Trust Service Criteria) | Almost every US mid-market buyer | 6-12 months | $30K-$100K |
| **SOC 2 Type I** | Point-in-time security snapshot | Good interim step | 3-6 months | $20K-$50K |
| **HIPAA** | Healthcare data protection | Healthcare clients | 3-6 months (if SOC 2 in place) | $15K-$40K+ |
| **GDPR** | EU data protection (you likely have this) | Companies with EU operations | Already in place (UK company) | — |
| **State Privacy Laws** | CCPA (California), CPRA, Virginia CDPA, Colorado CPA, etc. | All US consumers/clients | Ongoing | Legal counsel |

### AI-Specific Regulations (Emerging)
- **NYC Local Law 144** — Automated employment decision tools must undergo bias audits
- **Colorado AI Act (SB 24-205)** — Effective Feb 2026; requires impact assessments for "high-risk" AI systems
- **EU AI Act** — Relevant if serving US companies with EU operations
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** — Not mandatory but increasingly referenced in RFPs
- **Executive Order on AI (Oct 2023)** — Sets federal direction; expect more regulation

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start SOC 2 Type I immediately** — This is table stakes; you cannot sell to US mid-market without it
2. **Use Vanta, Drata, or Secureframe** to automate SOC 2 compliance (~$10K-$20K/yr for tooling)
3. **Engage a US-based auditor** (e.g., Johanson Berenson, Prescient Assurance) for the audit itself
4. **Draft a Security Whitepaper** — US buyers will ask for this before a first call
5. **Data residency** — Offer US-hosted data (AWS us-east-1 or us-west-2) as default for US clients
6. **Maintain a Trust/Security page** on your website — link to SOC 2 report, security practices

### Contracts & Legal
- US companies expect **MSA + SOW** (Master Service Agreement + Statement of Work) structure
- Standard US indemnification, limitation of liability, and IP ownership clauses differ from UK norms
- **Engage a US tech lawyer** (e.g., Cooley, Fenwick, or a boutique) — budget $10K-$25K for template contracts
- Include **arbitration clause** (typically AAA rules) — cheaper than US litigation
- Consider **Delaware LLC** for contracting (see Section 5)

## 4. US-Specific Messaging (vs UK)

### UK vs US Messaging Differences

| Dimension | UK Style | US Style |
|---|---|---|
| **Tone** | Understated, modest | Bold, confident, aspirational |
| **Proof** | "We've had some good results" | "We delivered 340% ROI in 90 days" |
| **Headlines** | Feature-focused | Outcome-focused |
| **Trust signals** | Logos, tenure | Metrics, case studies, G2/Gartner ratings |
| **Risk framing** | "Reduce risk" | "Don't get left behind" (FOMO + competitive advantage) |
| **CTA** | "Get in touch" | "Book a demo" / "Start free trial" |

### US Messaging Framework for AfrexAI

**Positioning statement:**
> "AfrexAI helps mid-market companies turn AI from a buzzword into measurable business results — faster time-to-value, proven ROI, enterprise-grade security."

**Key messages:**
1. **"AI that works, not AI that wows"** — Focus on practical business outcomes, not tech sophistication
2. **"Enterprise-grade AI, mid-market pricing"** — Position against both expensive consultancies (Accenture, Deloitte) and cheap freelancers
3. **"From pilot to production in 90 days"** — Speed is a massive differentiator in US market
4. **"Your data stays yours"** — Data privacy, SOC 2, no model training on client data
5. **"Built by practitioners, not theorists"** — Emphasise real-world implementation experience

**What NOT to say in the US:**
- Don't lead with "London-based" or "UK company" — it creates distance; instead say "global team"
- Don't be modest about results — US buyers interpret understatement as weakness
- Don't use British spellings on US-facing materials (optimise → optimize, colour → color)
- Don't reference GDPR as a primary trust signal — Americans care about SOC 2 first

### Content Strategy
- **Case studies** (minimum 3 before launching) — US-relevant industries, quantified results
- **ROI calculator** on website — interactive tool showing projected savings
- **Comparison pages** — "AfrexAI vs Accenture" / "AfrexAI vs in-house AI team"
- **Webinars** — US audiences attend webinars at high rates (Tuesday/Wednesday, 1pm EST)
- **LinkedIn thought leadership** — Primary B2B channel in US mid-market

## 5. Establishing US Presence Without a US Office

### Option 1: US Legal Entity (Recommended)
- **Form a Delaware LLC or C-Corp** — Delaware is the standard for tech; ~$500 to form
- **Use a registered agent** (e.g., Northwest Registered Agent, Incfile) — ~$100-$300/yr
- **Virtual office address** — WeWork, Regus, or similar for a US business address (~$50-$200/mo)
- **US bank account** — Mercury, Brex, or Relay for startups; requires US entity
- **EIN (Employer Identification Number)** — Free from IRS; needed for banking and tax

**Why this matters:** US mid-market buyers have vendor onboarding processes that often require a US entity, US bank, and W-9 (tax form). Without this, you'll lose deals at the procurement stage.

### Option 2: Employer of Record (EOR) for US Hires
- Use **Deel, Remote, Oyster, or Papaya Global** to hire US-based sales reps without a local entity
- Cost: typically 15-25% on top of salary
- Allows you to have "US-based" team members for timezone coverage and local credibility
- **Recommended first hire:** US-based Account Executive (AE) with mid-market SaaS experience

### Option 3: Channel Partners / Resellers
- Partner with US-based **IT consultancies, MSPs, or systems integrators** who already sell to mid-market
- They handle the relationship; you provide the AI capability
- Typical reseller margin: 20-30%
- Good for volume but you lose control of the customer relationship

### Recommended Approach
1. **Form Delaware LLC** (Month 1) — ~$1K all-in
2. **Open US bank account** via Mercury (Month 1)
3. **Hire first US AE via EOR** (Month 2-3) — target $80K-$120K base + commission
4. **Get a virtual office** in NYC or Chicago (Month 1)
5. **Attend 2-3 US conferences** per quarter for in-person relationship building
6. **Consider a small co-working presence** once you have 3+ US employees

### Key US Conferences for AI Services
- **AI Summit New York** (December)
- **Google Cloud Next** (April, Las Vegas)
- **AWS re:Invent** (November, Las Vegas)
- **SaaStr Annual** (September, SF) — great for mid-market SaaS
- **Gartner IT Symposium** (October, Orlando)
- **SXSW** (March, Austin) — emerging tech + networking

## 6. Payment & Billing Considerations

### Pricing
- **Price in USD** — non-negotiable for US market
- US buyers expect **annual contracts with monthly payment options**
- Standard SaaS pricing models: per-seat, per-API-call, or platform fee + usage
- Mid-market sweet spot: **$2K-$15K/month** for AI services; $50K-$200K annual contracts
- Offer **annual prepay discount** (typically 10-20%) — US CFOs love this

### Payment Processing
| Processor | Best For | Fees |
|---|---|---|
| **Stripe** | SaaS billing, subscriptions, invoicing | 2.9% + $0.30 |
| **Paddle** | Merchant of Record (handles tax/compliance for you) | 5% + $0.50 |
| **Chargebee** | Complex subscription management | $249-$549/mo + fees |
| **Bill.com** | Invoice-based enterprise billing | $45/mo+ |

### Recommendations
- **Stripe** for self-serve and SMB; **invoice-based (Net 30)** for mid-market/enterprise
- US mid-market companies often pay via **ACH transfer** (lower fees than card) or **wire**
- Accept **purchase orders (POs)** — many mid-market companies require PO-based procurement
- Offer **Net 30 payment terms** (standard); larger deals may request Net 45-60
- Use **Stripe Tax or Avalara** for automated US sales tax calculation

## 7. US Tax Implications

### Sales Tax
- **SaaS is taxable** in approximately 30+ US states (varies by state)
- After *South Dakota v. Wayfair* (2018), you have **economic nexus** obligations even without physical presence
- Thresholds vary: typically $100K in sales OR 200 transactions in a state triggers nexus
- **Solution:** Use Avalara, TaxJar, or Stripe Tax to automate — cost ~$5K-$15K/yr
- Some states exempt SaaS; others tax it as tangible personal property — it's a mess

### Federal Tax
- A **UK company selling to US customers** without a US office generally does NOT owe US federal income tax (protected by the US-UK tax treaty — Article 7: Business Profits)
- **However**, if you form a US LLC/Corp, that entity WILL owe US federal and state income tax
- **Structure carefully:** Consider a Delaware LLC that is a disregarded entity for US tax purposes (passes through to UK parent) — consult a cross-border tax advisor
- File **Form 5472** (if foreign-owned US LLC) — $25K penalty per failure to file

### Recommended Tax Setup
1. **Engage a US-UK cross-border tax advisor** (e.g., EY, BDO, or a boutique like Bambridge Accountants)
2. **Form Delaware LLC** owned by UK parent company
3. **Register for sales tax** in states where you have nexus (or use Paddle as Merchant of Record to avoid this)
4. **Transfer pricing documentation** — required for intercompany transactions between UK parent and US sub
5. **Budget $10K-$20K/yr** for US tax compliance

### Simplest Path: Merchant of Record
If you want to avoid most US tax complexity, use **Paddle or FastSpring** as your Merchant of Record. They:
- Become the seller to US customers
- Handle all sales tax collection and remittance
- Handle invoicing in USD
- You receive net revenue minus their fee (5%+)
- Trade-off: less control, slightly lower margins
