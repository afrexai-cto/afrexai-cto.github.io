## 1. Managed Services Market: What Companies Pay Today

Understanding existing managed service pricing establishes the **willingness-to-pay baseline** for AfrexAI's AI agent workforce offering.

### Managed IT Services
| Segment | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| SMB (per user) | $100–$150/user/mo | Basic monitoring, helpdesk, patching |
| Mid-market (per user) | $150–$400/user/mo | Full-stack IT, cybersecurity, compliance |
| Enterprise (per user) | $300–$500/user/mo | Dedicated teams, 24/7 NOC, strategic consulting |
| Enterprise (flat) | $10,000–$50,000+/mo | 200+ endpoints, custom SLAs |

### Managed Marketing Services
| Tier | Monthly Retainer | Scope |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Basic | $1,500–$4,000/mo | SEO or single-channel management |
| Mid-market | $5,000–$10,000/mo | Multi-channel, content + paid media |
| Full-service | $10,000–$25,000/mo | Strategy, creative, analytics, multi-channel |
| Enterprise | $25,000–$50,000+/mo | Dedicated team, brand, performance |

**Median mid-market retainer: $7,500/mo** (HubSpot Agency Growth Report, 2025)

### Fractional Executive Services
| Role | Hourly Rate | Monthly Retainer | Annual Equivalent |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Fractional CFO | $175–$450/hr | $3,000–$15,000/mo | $36K–$180K/yr |
| Fractional COO | $150–$400/hr | $5,000–$15,000/mo | $60K–$180K/yr |
| Fractional CMO | $150–$350/hr | $5,000–$12,000/mo | $60K–$144K/yr |

**Key insight:** Full-time equivalents cost $200K–$400K+ fully loaded. Fractional services deliver 70–80% of value at 20–40% of cost. **This is exactly the value prop for AI agents.**

### Managed DevOps / Cloud Services
| Tier | Monthly Cost | Scope |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Basic | $2,000–$5,000/mo | CI/CD management, monitoring |
| Standard | $5,000–$15,000/mo | Infrastructure management, security |
| Enterprise | $15,000–$50,000+/mo | Full platform engineering, SRE |

### Summary: Market Pricing Anchors
The US enterprise market routinely pays **$3,000–$25,000/month per function** for managed services. AfrexAI's pricing should anchor against these benchmarks — not against raw API costs.

## 2. AI Agent-Specific Pricing Models (2025–2026)

### Emerging Models in Market

| Model | Example | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
|-------|---------|-------------|------|------|
| **Per-conversation** | Salesforce Agentforce ($2/conversation) | Pay per completed interaction | Simple to understand | Unpredictable costs; backlash at scale |
| **Per-execution/task** | Agentman.ai | Fixed price per completed task | Predictable, outcome-adjacent | Hard to define task boundaries |
| **Outcome-based** | Sierra.ai | Pay only when business outcome achieved | Perfect value alignment | Attribution disputes, complex billing |
| **Usage-based (tokens/compute)** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Langbase | Pay for compute consumed | Scales linearly | Opaque to non-technical buyers |
| **Subscription + usage hybrid** | Most enterprise deals in 2025 | Platform fee + metered usage above cap | Predictable base, scales up | Complexity |
| **Per-agent seat** | Emerging model (2026) | Monthly fee per deployed AI agent | Familiar to SaaS buyers | May under/over-charge vs value |
| **Credit-based** | Salesforce Flex Credits | Buy credit packs, consume across agents | Flexible | "What does a credit mean?" |

### What's Actually Working in 2025–2026

**The winner: Hybrid subscription + usage.** Per Metronome's 2025 field report:
- Most enterprise AI deals use **usage-based or hybrid pricing**
- Pure outcome-based pricing remains rare (attribution too hard)
- **Customer anxiety about unpredictable costs is the #1 adoption barrier**
- Companies see 30–50% markup on cost-plus credit models
- AI-native startups reaching $5–10M ARR faster than prior SaaS generations

**Salesforce Agentforce lesson:** The $2/conversation model drew extensive criticism and was revised to Flex Credits in mid-2025. Key learning: **per-conversation feels like a taxi meter** — customers hate it.

**Emerging consensus for managed AI agents:**
> "$5,000/month for the agent, which includes up to 1,000 tasks; then $2 per task beyond that"
> — Monetizely, 2026 Guide to Agentic Pricing

### AfrexAI Recommended Model: **Tiered Subscription + Value Overage**

Based on market evidence, AfrexAI should use:
1. **Monthly/annual subscription per agent workforce** (predictable base)
2. **Generous included capacity** (reduces adoption anxiety)
3. **Transparent overage pricing** for burst usage
4. **Outcome-based bonuses** as optional add-on for mature customers

## 3. Unit Economics Deep Dive

### The Value Equation

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Human work replaced per agent | 20 hrs/week |
| Blended human cost | $50/hr (US average for skilled knowledge work) |
| Monthly value created | **$4,333/mo** ($50 × 20hrs × 4.33 weeks) |
| Annual value created | **$52,000/yr per agent** |

### Cost to Deliver (AfrexAI)

| Cost Component | Monthly per Agent | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|-------|
| LLM API costs (inference) | $200–$800 | Depends on task complexity, model choice |
| Infrastructure (hosting, orchestration) | $50–$150 | Amortized across customer base |
| Monitoring & quality assurance | $100–$200 | Human-in-loop oversight |
| Customer success (amortized) | $100–$300 | Onboarding, support, optimization |
| **Total COGS per agent** | **$450–$1,450/mo** | |
| **Target gross margin** | **70–80%** | In line with SaaS benchmarks |

### Willingness-to-Pay Curve

Based on managed services benchmarks and the "30% of value created" rule:

| Pricing Strategy | Monthly Price | % of Value | Buyer Psychology |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Aggressive penetration | $999/mo | 23% | "No brainer" — easy yes |
| **Sweet spot** | **$1,500–$2,500/mo** | **35–58%** | **Strong ROI, easy to justify** |
| Premium/high-touch | $3,000–$4,000/mo | 69–92% | Needs proof, enterprise only |
| Value parity | $4,333/mo | 100% | Hard sell — why not hire? |

**The 30-50% rule:** Enterprise buyers typically accept paying 30-50% of the value created. For a $4,333/mo value agent, the sweet spot is **$1,300–$2,167/mo**.

**However:** Managed service buyers pay for **reliability, not just cost savings**. AI agents that are always-on, never sick, infinitely scalable — that commands a premium. Target **$1,500–$3,000/mo per agent** depending on complexity.

### Multi-Agent Workforce Economics

Most customers won't buy one agent — they'll buy a **workforce**:

| Workforce Size | Monthly Price | Effective $/Agent | Annual Value |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1–2 agents (Starter) | $2,500–$5,000/mo | $2,500 | $30K–$60K |
| 3–5 agents (Growth) | $5,000–$10,000/mo | $1,667–$2,000 | $60K–$120K |
| 6–10 agents (Scale) | $10,000–$20,000/mo | $1,667–$2,000 | $120K–$240K |
| 10+ agents (Enterprise) | $20,000–$50,000+/mo | $1,500–$2,000 | $240K–$600K |

Volume discount incentivizes larger deployments while maintaining strong margins.

## 4. Churn Analysis: What Makes Managed Service Customers Stay vs Leave

### Industry Churn Benchmarks

| Segment | Monthly Churn | Annual Churn | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| SaaS (overall) | 3–8% | 32–50% | Wide range |
| B2B SaaS (2025 avg) | 3.5% monthly | ~35% annual | Vitally benchmark |
| Enterprise SaaS (ARPU >$500) | — | 2–6% | Paddle data |
| Annual contracts | — | 8.5% | vs 16% monthly |
| Enterprise (large contracts) | — | 1–2% | Best-in-class |
| Managed IT services | — | 10–15% | Industry average |

### Why Customers Leave (Managed Services)

1. **Lack of measurable ROI** (42%) — Can't prove value to leadership
2. **Poor communication/responsiveness** (28%) — Feeling ignored
3. **Scope creep without price adjustment** (15%) — Costs rise, value doesn't
4. **Internal capability build-out** (10%) — "We can do this ourselves now"
5. **Competitive displacement** (5%) — Better/cheaper alternative

### Why Customers Stay

1. **Switching costs are high** — Retraining, integration, knowledge transfer
2. **Measurable, demonstrated ROI** — Monthly/quarterly business reviews with data
3. **Deep integration** — Agent workflows embedded in business processes
4. **Relationship & trust** — Dedicated CSM, proactive optimization
5. **Continuous improvement** — Agents get better over time (compounding value)

### AfrexAI Churn Mitigation Strategy

| Strategy | Target Impact |
|----------|-------------|
| Annual contracts with 10–15% discount | Reduce churn from ~16% to ~8% |
| Quarterly Business Reviews with ROI dashboards | Prove value continuously |
| Deep workflow integration (make switching painful) | Increase switching costs |
| Dedicated Customer Success Manager ($100K+ accounts) | Relationship retention |
| Continuous agent optimization (agents improve monthly) | Compounding value |
| **Target annual logo churn** | **<10%** |
| **Target net revenue retention** | **110–120%** (expansion > churn) |

## 7. Strategic Recommendations

### Pricing Strategy
1. **Anchor to human cost replacement, not API costs** — Customers don't care what GPT-4 costs; they care about replacing a $75K/yr employee
2. **Use tiered subscriptions** — Predictability wins. Credits and per-conversation models create buyer anxiety
3. **Include generous capacity** — Overages should be the exception, not the expectation
4. **Annual contracts by default** — 60%+ on annual; reduces churn by ~50%
5. **Outcome-based pricing as premium add-on** — Not the default; too complex for early customers

### Go-to-Market Priorities
1. **Start with 2–3 vertical use cases** (e.g., managed marketing agent, managed customer support agent, managed finance/ops agent)
2. **Pilot program with 5 design partners** — Free/discounted, heavy onboarding
3. **Build ROI calculator** — "Your marketing coordinator costs $55K/yr. Our AI agent costs $27K/yr and works 24/7"
4. **Publish case studies aggressively** — Managed service buyers need social proof
5. **Target companies already buying managed services** — They've already decided to outsource; now sell them the upgrade

### Competitive Moat
- **Not just agents, but managed agents** — You run them, optimize them, guarantee outcomes
- **Switching costs** — Deep integration into customer workflows
- **Compounding intelligence** — Agents learn the customer's business over time
- **White-glove onboarding** — Enterprise implementation ($50K–$200K for competitors)
