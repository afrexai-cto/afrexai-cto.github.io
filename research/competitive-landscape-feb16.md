# Competitive Landscape Update — Feb 16, 2026

## Key Competitors in AI Agent Consulting for FSI

### Tier 1 — Big Consultancies (our "too slow, too expensive" foils)
- **Accenture** — broad digital transformation, AI is one of many offerings
- **Deloitte** — strong brand, slow delivery, $500K+ minimums
- **BCG** — strategy-heavy, less hands-on implementation

### Tier 2 — AI-Focused Boutiques (direct competitors)
- **Neurons Lab** (UK/Singapore) — AI-exclusive, FSI focus, 100+ clients (HSBC, Visa, AXA). Strong positioning. Certified in multiple AI platforms. *CLOSEST COMPETITOR.*
- **Sia Partners** — Launched "Agent Store" with 400+ agents. Consulting + marketplace hybrid.
- **Cognizant** — Accelerator framework for legacy integration. Enterprise-grade but slow.

### Tier 3 — AI-Native Startups
- **Complyance** — $20M Series A (Google Ventures), GRC agents for HIPAA/ISO/NIST. Compliance-first vertical.
- **DataRobot** — Platform play, not services. Different model.

## Our Differentiation vs Each

| vs | Their weakness | Our advantage |
|----|---------------|---------------|
| Big 4 | 6-12 month timelines, $500K+ min, slide decks not agents | 30-day delivery, $140K-$800K, working agents from Day 1 |
| Neurons Lab | Broader FSI focus, less vertical depth | Deep vertical playbooks (legal, healthcare, finserv), managed ongoing |
| Sia Partners | Agent marketplace = generic | Custom agents tuned to your ops, managed 24/7 |
| Complyance | Compliance-only, VC-funded (burn rate risk) | Full-stack agent workforce, bootstrapped (aligned incentives) |

## Positioning Statement
"While big consultancies sell AI strategy and startups sell AI platforms, AfrexAI deploys working AI agent workforces in 30 days — managed, monitored, and delivering ROI from Month 1."

## Action Items
- [ ] Monitor Neurons Lab closely — they're the closest comp in FSI
- [ ] Use Sia Partners' 400-agent store as validation ("even consultancies are building agent marketplaces")
- [ ] Complyance's $20M raise = social proof that compliance-first AI has investor confidence
