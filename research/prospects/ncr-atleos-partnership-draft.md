# NCR Atleos Partnership Outreach Draft
*Created: 2026-02-21*

## Target: Rohan Pal, CIO — NCR Atleos
- Appointed CIO recently, ex-ServiceNow (transformation DNA)
- NCR Atleos serves community banks with ATM/self-service tech
- Their client base = our ideal customer profile

## Why Partnership Makes Sense
- NCR Atleos already has trusted relationships with hundreds of community banks
- They handle infrastructure (ATMs, self-service) — we handle AI operations
- No overlap, pure complement: their hardware/platform + our managed AI agents
- Rohan's ServiceNow background means he understands workflow automation value

## Draft Email (for Christina to send)

**Subject:** Community banks are asking for AI ops — let's give it to them together

Hi Rohan,

Congrats on the CIO role at Atleos. Your ServiceNow background tells me you already know what I'm about to say: community banks want AI that actually works in their operations, not another vendor demo.

We're AfrexAI. We deploy managed AI agents for community banks — fraud detection, compliance automation, document processing — the operational stuff that's too complex for banks to build in-house but too important to ignore.

Here's what caught my attention: your community bank clients already trust Atleos for their core infrastructure. They're going to ask you about AI (if they haven't already). We could be the answer you give them.

Quick version of what a partnership looks like:
- You refer banks that need AI operations → we deploy and manage
- Revenue share on every deployment
- Your clients get AI without the risk of building it themselves
- You deepen your relationship without adding headcount

Would 20 minutes next week make sense to explore this? Happy to share what we've deployed so far.

Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
