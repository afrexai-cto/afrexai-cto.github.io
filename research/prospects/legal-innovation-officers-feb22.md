## New Named Prospects

### 1. White & Case — Isabel Parker, Chief Innovation Officer
- **Firm:** White & Case LLP (2,200+ lawyers, 44 offices globally)
- **Role:** Leads global innovation — AI adoption, client-facing solutions, knowledge initiatives
- **Why:** Named as top legal tech leader for 2026. Global firm actively deploying AI.
- **Angle:** Too big for AfrexAI's current sweet spot (2,200 attorneys), but could be a reference/case study play or intro to their mid-market clients
- **ICP Score:** 5 (too large, but influential)
- **Status:** Research only — do not outreach

### 2. Troutman Pepper Locke — Will Gaus, Chief Knowledge & Innovation Officer
- **Firm:** Troutman Pepper Locke LLP (1,200+ attorneys, US-focused)
- **Role:** Chief Knowledge Management and Innovation Officer
- **Why:** Quoted in Law360: "2026 Focus: Ensuring AI Delivers" — firm actively transitioning from AI experimentation to production
- **Angle:** "Ensuring AI delivers" = our exact value prop. They've identified the pilot-to-production gap publicly.
- **ICP Score:** 6 (large but US-focused, right mindset)
- **Status:** Research — possible content mention ("firms like Troutman Pepper are focused on ensuring AI delivers...")

### 3. Fisher Phillips — Pritesh Patel, Director of AI *(already tracked)*

## Mid-Size Firm Targets to Research Next
Based on patterns: firms with 50-500 attorneys, US-focused, hiring for innovation/AI roles

- Polsinelli (1,000 attorneys, AM Law 100 — healthcare + financial services heavy)
- Cozen O'Connor (775 attorneys — insurance, litigation, business law)
- Blank Rome (600 attorneys — finserv, maritime, government)
- Seyfarth Shaw (900 attorneys — known for legal tech innovation, SeyfarthLean)
- Littler Mendelson (1,800 attorneys — labor & employment, direct Fisher Phillips competitor)

## Key Insight
The "Chief Innovation Officer" role is now standard at Am Law 200 firms. These people have BUDGET and MANDATE to deploy AI. They're our decision-makers. Target the CIO/CKIO, not the managing partner.
