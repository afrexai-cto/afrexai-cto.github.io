# Tier 2 Prospects: Funded Fintechs with Compliance Needs
*Created: 2026-02-14 | These are fintechs that NEED compliance automation but may not have built it in-house yet*

## Why These Targets?
Series B-D fintechs with $50M+ raised have:
- Budget for compliance tooling ($200K-$500K/year)
- Growing regulatory burden as they scale
- Often using manual processes or basic tools
- Need to pass audits for next funding round / IPO

## Prospect List

### 1. Sardine — AI Risk Platform
- **Raised:** $70M Series C (2025), led by Activant Capital
- **Investors:** a16z, Nyca Partners, Google Ventures
- **Focus:** Fraud, compliance, credit underwriting
- **Angle:** COMPETITOR/PARTNER — they sell tools, we sell managed implementation. Could be a referral partner (they sell software, we implement + manage for their clients who need hands-on help)
- **CEO:** Soups Ranjan (co-founders: Zahid Shaikh, Aditya Goel)
- **Scale:** 250+ businesses, 150+ countries
- **Contact approach:** Partnership angle via LinkedIn to Soups — "software + services" co-sell model

### 2. TRM Labs — RegTech/Crypto AML
- **Raised:** $70M Series C (Feb 2026)
- **Focus:** AI for criminal network disruption, national security
- **Angle:** COMPETITOR in crypto AML space, but their clients may need broader compliance agents beyond just blockchain analysis. Partnership opportunity for non-crypto compliance.
- **Contact:** Research BD/partnerships team

### 3. Omnius — Insurance/Claims AI (Germany)
- **Raised:** $56M Series C (Apr 2025), ~$84M total
- **Focus:** Insurance document processing
- **Customers:** 80+ institutional
- **Angle:** Adjacent — their customers (insurers) also need AML/compliance agents. Co-sell opportunity for European market.
- **Contact:** Research partnerships lead

### 4. NEXT RESEARCH NEEDED
- Pull from growthlist.co/fintech-startups and topstartups.io filtered for fintech + compliance
- Focus on: payment processors, neobanks, lending platforms, crypto exchanges
- All of these have BSA/AML obligations and likely outgrowing their compliance teams

## Fintech Compliance Pain Points (for outreach)
- Scaling from 10 → 100 SAR filings/month with same team
- Preparing for state money transmitter audits
- Meeting OCC/FDIC expectations for bank partnerships
- CFPB examinations getting stricter
- Need SOC 2 + AML program for enterprise clients

## Draft Outreach Angle
"You raised $X to grow fast. Your compliance team didn't get the same raise. We build AI agent workforces that scale your compliance without scaling headcount."
