# Manufacturing AI Targets — Feb 22, 2026
**Vertical:** Manufacturing (UNDERSERVED in our pipeline)
**Thesis:** Mid-market manufacturers ($50M-$500M) face quality compliance (ISO, FDA for med devices), supply chain complexity, and workforce shortages. AI agents for predictive quality, compliance documentation, supplier risk monitoring.

## Why Manufacturing NOW
- Industry 4.0 spending accelerating but most stuck at dashboard/BI level
- ISO 9001/13485 audit documentation is manual nightmare (40-60 hrs/audit prep)
- FDA 21 CFR Part 11 for med device manufacturers = compliance mandate
- Supply chain disruptions (2020-2025) created permanent demand for AI risk monitoring
- Labor shortage: 2.1M unfilled manufacturing jobs by 2030 (Deloitte/NAM)

## Target Profile
- Revenue: $50M-$500M (big enough to afford, small enough to not have internal AI teams)
- Sectors: Medical devices, aerospace parts, food/beverage, automotive components
- Signals: Hiring quality engineers, recently failed audits, expanding production, new facilities

## Named Targets (to research with Brave when quota resets)
1. **Jabil** — contract manufacturer, $33B revenue but mid-market divisions. Heavy compliance.
2. **Integer Holdings** — medical device components, $1.6B. FDA-regulated. Quality compliance critical.
3. **Meggitt** (now Parker Hannifin division) — aerospace. AS9100 compliance.
4. **Precision Castparts** — Berkshire subsidiary, aerospace/industrial. Quality-obsessed.
5. **Nuvectra** — medical device, smaller ($20M range). FDA 21 CFR Part 11 mandatory.
6. **Mesa Labs** — test/measurement for pharma/food. Quality compliance is their entire business.
7. **Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical** — rare disease biotech, manufacturing scale-up phase.

## Outreach Angle
"Your quality team spends 40+ hours prepping for every ISO audit. What if that was 4 hours?"
"FDA expects continuous compliance documentation. Manual processes create gaps between audits."
"2.1 million unfilled manufacturing jobs by 2030. AI agents don't quit."
