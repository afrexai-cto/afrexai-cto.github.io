# Mid-Market P&C Insurance Carrier Targets
*Created: 2026-02-15 | Vertical: Insurance AI Compliance*

## Why These Targets
- Colorado Reg 10-1-1 expanded Aug 2025 → auto + health insurers now in scope
- Mid-market carriers (10-30 states) have AI in underwriting but lack governance teams
- "AI Trailblazers" per Carrier Management research = already using AI, need compliance NOW
- Sweet spot: $500M-$5B premium volume, 10-25 states, no dedicated AI governance team

## Prospect 1: Donegal Group
- **HQ:** Marietta, Pennsylvania
- **Size:** ~$1B premium, 22 states
- **AI Status:** Named "AI Trailblazer" by Carrier Management (Dec 2024) — actively deploying AI
- **Why:** Trailblazer designation means they're using AI aggressively but are regional = likely no dedicated compliance team for AI governance
- **Target Contact:** Chief Risk Officer or VP Underwriting
- **Angle:** "You're an AI Trailblazer — congratulations. Now every regulator in your 22 states knows it too."
- **Est. Deal:** $150K-$200K

## Prospect 2: Heritage Insurance Holdings
- **HQ:** Tampa, Florida
- **Size:** ~$800M premium, focus on coastal P&C
- **AI Status:** Also named "AI Trailblazer" — using AI in catastrophe modeling + claims
- **Why:** Florida + coastal = heavy regulatory scrutiny, AI in cat modeling is high-stakes
- **Target Contact:** Chief Compliance Officer
- **Angle:** AI in catastrophe pricing is exactly what regulators want to examine first
- **Est. Deal:** $120K-$180K
- **Status:** Need to identify exact contact

## Prospect 3: Safety Insurance Group
- **HQ:** Boston, Massachusetts
- **Size:** ~$1.1B premium, primarily Northeast
- **AI Status:** Named "AI Trailblazer" — highlighted for specific AI initiatives
- **Why:** Massachusetts has its own AI oversight momentum, Northeast regulators are aggressive
- **Target Contact:** VP Compliance / Chief Risk Officer
- **Angle:** Northeast regulatory environment is tightening — governance now = competitive moat
- **Est. Deal:** $130K-$170K
- **Status:** Need to identify exact contact
