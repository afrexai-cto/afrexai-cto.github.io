# Seyfarth Shaw LLP — Target Profile
*Researched: 2026-02-22*

## Firm Overview
- **Am Law 100 firm**, ~900 attorneys, 17 offices globally
- Known legal tech innovator — **SeyfarthLean** consulting arm (process improvement + tech)
- **Seyfarth Labs** — in-house innovation team exploring AI, automation, emerging tech

## Key Decision Makers
- **Byong Kim** — Chief Data & AI Officer (NEW C-suite role)
- **Zeynep Ersin** — Chief Innovation & Strategic Design Officer (NEW C-suite role)
- **Lorie Almon** — Managing Partner, vocal about AI innovation

## AI Maturity
- ADVANCED — already using Microsoft Copilot, built custom "Doc Q&A" tool in-house
- AI training programs for summer associates
- Gathering "superuser" feedback to decide next AI moves (Law360)
- Currently in "what's next?" phase — piloted tools, now scaling

## Outreach Angle
- They're past pilots, deciding what's next — perfect timing for managed AI agents
- Two new C-suite roles = budget + mandate confirmed
- SeyfarthLean already sells process consulting to OTHER law firms — potential **partnership** (they resell our AI implementation to their consulting clients)
- Byong Kim (CDAIO) is THE target — new in role, building strategy

## Email Hook
"Seyfarth Labs built Doc Q&A. Your superusers love the tools. But scaling from superusers to firm-wide autonomous AI workflows is a different challenge — that's what we do."

## Partnership Angle (HIGH LEVERAGE)
SeyfarthLean Consulting advises other law firms on process improvement. If we partner with SeyfarthLean, they become a distribution channel — recommending our managed AI agents to their consulting clients. One partnership = access to dozens of mid-market firms.
