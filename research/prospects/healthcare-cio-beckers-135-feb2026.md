## Outreach Strategy
1. **HHS AI Governance angle** — April 3, 2026 deadline. Every hospital CIO needs AI governance NOW.
2. **Lead with compliance, sell implementation** — "Your AI governance framework needs working AI agents underneath it"
3. **CHOP/Tampa General as social proof** — reference what peers are doing (without naming as clients)
4. **Target new CIOs** (e.g., Chris Akeroyd, new Jun 2025) — they need quick wins to prove themselves

## Email Subject Lines (A/B test)
- "April 3 HHS deadline — is your AI governance framework ready?"
- "[Org Name]'s AI agents: from pilot to production in 30 days"
- "What CHOP and Tampa General know about scaling AI that most hospitals don't"
