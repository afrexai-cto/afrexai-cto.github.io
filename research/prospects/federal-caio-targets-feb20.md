# Federal CAIO Targets — Feb 20, 2026
*Source: GovCIOMedia, ExecutiveGov*

## Context
Trump admin's April 2025 AI memo + Biden's 2023 EO = every federal agency must have a CAIO. OMB launched CAIO AI Council. These agencies need implementation partners, not just governance frameworks.

## Key Targets

### 1. HHS — Clark Minor (CIO + Acting CAIO)
- Dual-hatted = stretched thin, needs external implementation support
- HHS AI governance mandate deadline: April 3, 2026 (42 days)
- Healthcare vertical overlap — our strongest positioning

### 2. OPM — Perryn Ashmore (Acting CAIO)
- Office of Personnel Management — workforce automation is their entire mandate
- AI for HR/workforce = direct use case for managed AI agents

### 3. NARA — Former CTO Shakir now CAIO
- National Archives — document processing, classification, search
- Perfect for AI agent deployment (document review, metadata extraction)

## Approach
- Federal procurement is slow (6-12 months) but HUGE contracts ($500K-$5M+)
- HHS deadline creates urgency — target HHS contractors and sub-contractors first
- Consider GSA Schedule or partnership with existing GovCon firm for faster entry
- Christina should connect with these CAIOs on LinkedIn — they're all publicly listed

## Priority: MEDIUM
- Long sales cycle but massive ACV potential
- Better as Q3-Q4 pipeline than immediate revenue
- Focus energy on private sector finserv/legal/healthcare first
