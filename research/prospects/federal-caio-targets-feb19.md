# Federal Agency CAIO Targets — Feb 19, 2026

## Context
Trump administration AI memo + Biden's 2023 EO mandates every federal agency appoint a Chief AI Officer. These CAIOs need to show results FAST — perfect for AfrexAI's "Week I Win" promise.

## Why This Matters
- Federal AI spending: $3.3B+ in FY2026
- Every agency MUST have a CAIO — many are brand new to the role
- New CAIOs need quick wins to justify their appointment
- Government contracting = sticky, multi-year deals ($500K-$2M+)

## Barrier
- Need SAM.gov registration + potentially GSA Schedule for federal work
- FedRAMP for cloud services (long process)
- BUT: can start as subcontractor to existing GovCon primes

## Potential Path
1. Partner with existing GovCon AI firms as subcontractor (faster to revenue)
2. Target state/local government first (lower barriers than federal)
3. Use federal mandate as proof point for private sector pitches ("Even the government is mandating AI officers — what's your plan?")

## Immediate Use
The federal CAIO mandate is a SALES ARGUMENT for private sector:
- "The US government now requires every agency to have a Chief AI Officer. If the federal government thinks AI leadership is mandatory, where does that leave your organization?"
- Use in cold emails, LinkedIn posts, and pitch decks

## Next Steps
- [ ] Draft cold email template using federal mandate angle
- [ ] Research state-level AI mandates (CA, NY, TX likely leaders)
- [ ] Identify GovCon AI primes open to subcontracting partnerships
