# Referral Partner Targets — Boutique Consultancies
*Created: 2026-02-19 18:58 GMT*

## Why These Firms?
These are boutique/mid-size consultancies that do digital transformation and strategy but are NOT AI-native builders. They advise clients who ask about AI but need an implementation partner. AfrexAI fills that gap. 15% rev share on introductions.

## Target List

### 1. Airiodion Group Consulting (AGC)
- **Type:** Boutique change management & digital transformation
- **HQ:** USA
- **Why:** They explicitly say they're "not technology-led" — they do the change management, we do the AI build. Perfect complement.
- **Website:** airiodion.com
- **Outreach:** Christina → LinkedIn connect with founder, then partner email sequence

### 2. Six Paths Consulting
- **Type:** Boutique AI strategy advisory
- **HQ:** USA
- **Why:** They list AI consulting companies but likely refer out implementation work. Could be a two-way referral (they do strategy, we do build).
- **Website:** sixpathsconsulting.com
- **Outreach:** Partner email sequence

### 3. Panneo AI
- **Type:** Boutique AI + sustainability consulting
- **HQ:** USA/EU
- **Why:** Project-based, sustainability-focused. Their clients need AI implementation but Panneo focuses on strategy. AfrexAI handles the agent workforce build.
- **Outreach:** Partner email sequence

### 4. Neurons Lab
- **Type:** AI consulting for financial services institutions
- **HQ:** Ukraine/USA
- **Why:** Explicitly targets mid-to-enterprise FSIs. If they're capacity-constrained or have clients wanting agent-based automation (not their core), we complement.
- **Website:** neurons-lab.com
- **Outreach:** Partner email — position as "agent workforce" specialist vs their data science/ML focus

### 5. RTS Labs
- **Type:** AI consulting, data engineering, MLOps
- **HQ:** Richmond, VA
- **Why:** Published "9 Best AI Consulting Firms" list (Feb 15) — they're actively marketing. Mid-market focus. Could be competitor OR partner depending on capacity. Worth exploring.
- **Website:** rtslabs.com
- **Note:** More likely competitor than partner — monitor first, approach carefully

### 6. MSH (Management Solutions & Hiring)
- **Type:** Digital transformation consulting + talent
- **HQ:** USA
- **Why:** They do transformation consulting but also talent. Could refer AI implementation work to us while they handle the org/talent side.
- **Website:** talentmsh.com

### 7. Fractional CTO/CIO Firms (Category)
- **Examples to find:** Search LinkedIn for "fractional CTO" + "AI strategy"
- **Why:** These individuals advise 3-5 companies each. One relationship = 3-5 warm intros. Highest leverage partner type.
- **Action:** LinkedIn search → build list of 10 fractional CTOs serving mid-market

## Priority Order
1. Airiodion Group (best fit — change management, not AI-native)
2. Fractional CTO network (highest leverage per relationship)
3. Six Paths Consulting (strategy-only, needs implementation partner)
4. MSH (transformation + talent, complementary)
5. Neurons Lab (FSI overlap — explore carefully)
