# Construction Vertical — Target Prospects (Feb 22, 2026)
*Source: ENR Top 400, PYMNTS, industry research*

## Why Construction, Why Now
- $177B annual waste from coordination failures
- Market: $405M (2026) → $6.07B (2034) — 44.8% CAGR
- Labor shortage: 650K+ unfilled US positions
- Regulators now expect predictive safety, not retrospective reports
- Mid-market stuck in "pilot purgatory" — our sweet spot

## Ideal Construction Prospect Profile
- Revenue: $100M-$1B (ENR Top 100-400 range)
- US-based general contractor or specialty contractor
- Already using Procore/BIM360/PlanGrid (data exists, coordination doesn't)
- Recently hired VP of Technology / CIO / Innovation Director
- Multi-state operations (compliance complexity multiplier)
- Healthcare, data center, or infrastructure focus (higher compliance bar)
