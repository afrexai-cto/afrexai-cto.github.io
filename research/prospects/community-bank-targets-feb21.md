# Community Bank AI Targets — Feb 21, 2026

## From MassLive Article (Feb 2026) — Named Executives
| Bank | Executive | Title | Location | AI Status | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Country Bank | Marco Bernasconi Jr. | COO & Chief Innovation Officer | MA | Building data warehouse ("data lake"), not yet using AI day-to-day | PERFECT PROSPECT — has the vision, building infrastructure, needs implementation partner |
| Monson Savings Bank | Dan Moriarty | President | Monson, MA | Using AI for prep, needs-spotting, personalization | Already bought in on AI value — upsell to managed agents |

## Why These Are High-Value
- Both publicly quoted about AI strategy → they're thinking about it
- Country Bank is pre-AI (data warehouse phase) → perfect timing for "AI Workforce Strategy" consultation
- Monson is using basic AI → ready for agent-level automation
- Both in Massachusetts → can cluster for regional approach
- Community bank size = sweet spot for $140K-$360K ACV

## Outreach Angle
- Reference their own quotes from the MassLive article (personalization)
- Lead with: "You're building the data lake — here's how to turn it into an AI workforce"
- Use CSI survey (27% of community banks listed AI as #1 concern) as social proof
- Attach the blog post: "Why Community Banks Need an AI Workforce Strategy"

## Next Steps
- [ ] Find LinkedIn profiles for Bernasconi and Moriarty
- [ ] Draft personalized outreach emails referencing their quotes
- [ ] Research Country Bank and Monson Savings Bank size (assets, employees)
- [ ] Identify 3-5 more MA community banks for regional cluster approach
