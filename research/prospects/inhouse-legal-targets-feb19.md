# In-House Legal Team Targets — Feb 19, 2026
*Angle: AI agents to cut outside counsel spend 40-60%*

## Hot Prospects (New Appointments = Need Quick Wins)

### 1. Crusoe Energy (AI Infrastructure Company)
- **Contact:** Jamey Seely — Chief Legal Officer & Secretary
- **Why:** AI-native company (GPU cloud/data centers), expanding governance. New GC for real estate = growing legal complexity. AI company that should eat its own dog food with AI legal tools.
- **Angle:** "You sell AI infrastructure. Your legal team should be running on AI agents too."

### 2. QII (Portfolio Company of Quality Growth Companies)
- **Contact:** Alex Rose — General Counsel & Chief Commercial Officer (appointed Jan 2026)
- **Why:** New appointment, scaling company, dual GC+CCO role means stretched thin. Needs efficiency tools NOW.
- **Angle:** "You just took on two C-suite roles at once. AI agents can give you back 20 hours a week on contract review alone."

### 3. Gemini (Crypto Exchange — Post-Restructuring)
- **Contact:** Kate Freedman — Interim General Counsel (appointed Feb 2026)
- **Why:** Just lost CLO + COO + CFO. 25% staff cuts. Interim GC needs to prove value fast with fewer resources. Regulatory-heavy industry.
- **Angle:** "Your team just got smaller. Your compliance burden didn't. AI agents close that gap."

## Strategy
- These are all companies in transition (new hires, restructuring, scaling) — the moment legal teams are most open to new tools
- Target the "first 90 days" window when new GCs are building their stack
- In-house teams are the BUYER now, not law firms (per Above the Law Feb 2026 analysis)
