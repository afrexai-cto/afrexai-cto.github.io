## New Appointments (HIGH PRIORITY — warm window 30-60 days)

| Name | Title | Organization | Location | Notes |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Teresa Tonthat | Chief Digital & Information Officer | Cook Children's Health Care | Fort Worth, TX | New CDIO — pediatric health system |
| Aaron Wootton | VP IT & CIO | Stormont Vail Health | Topeka, KS | New appointment |
| Anika Gardenhire, RN | Chief Digital & Information Officer | Michigan Medicine | Ann Arbor, MI | FIRST-EVER CDIO — huge signal, nursing background = clinician-first AI |
| Thomas (Mac) Marlow | VP & Chief Digital & Information Officer | Bayhealth | Dover, DE | New appointment |
| Steve LeBlond | Chief Information & Digital Officer | Prisma Health | Greenville, SC | Replacing retired Rich Rogers — $4B+ system |
| Donna Roach | System Chief Digital & Information Officer | University of Utah Health | Salt Lake City, UT | Promoted — expanded role |

## Why These Matter
- 53% of healthcare CIOs have been in role <3 years (WittKieffer 2024)
- New CIOs need quick wins in first 90 days → most receptive to vendor conversations
- HHS AI governance mandate deadline: April 3, 2026 (42 days away)
- All are taking "digital" titles — signals AI/digital transformation mandate

## Top 3 Targets (by system size + timing)
1. **Anika Gardenhire — Michigan Medicine** — FIRST-EVER CDIO, major academic medical center, Ann Arbor. Massive budget. Creating the role from scratch = greenfield opportunity.
2. **Steve LeBlond — Prisma Health** — $4B+ system, replacing retired CIO, needs to establish credibility fast. Greenville SC.
3. **Teresa Tonthat — Cook Children's** — Pediatric specialty, Fort Worth TX. Specialty systems often move faster on innovation.
