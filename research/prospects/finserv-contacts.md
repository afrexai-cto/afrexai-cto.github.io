## Raymond James Financial (Tampa, FL)
- **Brock Miller** — SVP, Deputy Chief BSA/AML Officer
  - LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/brock-miller-b5700664/
  - Angle: WorkFusion transition, AI agent automation for AML/BSA
  - Note: Large firm, likely enterprise deal ($200K+ ACV)

## Valley Bank (Wayne, NJ)  
- **Chief Enterprise Compliance Officer & Head of Regulatory Relations** — name partially redacted in directory (initial H.)
  - Note: Previous BSA/AML Director (Leary) left for Provident Bank — possible new hire, fresh eyes on tooling
  - **Amy Lubow** — Compliance Manager

  - Note: Valley National Bank merged to "Valley Bank" brand

## Enova International (Chicago, IL) — NYSE: ENVA
- **Sean Rahilly** — General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer (since 2013, CCO role; GC since 2018)
  - Angle: $67B+ loans originated using ML underwriting. Colorado SB 24-205 directly impacts them. AI bias audits, decision documentation.
  - Note: Leadership changes announced Jul 2025 (David Fisher departing as CEO). New leadership = new budget cycles, openness to vendors.

  - Angle: Denver-based fintech using AI for homeowner engagement. Colorado SB 24-205 directly in scope. Small enough to move fast (83 employees).
  - Note: Real estate/mortgage tech — AI recommendations to homeowners = "consequential decisions" under SB 24-205.
