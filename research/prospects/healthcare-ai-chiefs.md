## Pitch Angles

### Primary: HHS AI Governance Compliance (April 3 deadline)
"Your AI governance deadline is 6 weeks away. We deploy AI agents WITH built-in governance — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, human oversight, audit trails. Not just compliance docs — working, governed agents."

### Secondary: Agentic AI Implementation Partner
"61% of health systems are building agentic AI (Deloitte, Feb 2026). 98% expect 10%+ cost savings. But most don't have the team to deploy and manage agents at scale. That's us."

### Tertiary: Clinical Documentation + Claims Processing
"Klarna saved $60M replacing 700 FTEs with AI agents. Your claims processing, prior auth, and clinical documentation are the equivalent back-office — same ROI, healthcare-specific."

## Outreach Priority Order
1. **Micky Tripathi @ Mayo Clinic** — Former HHS, knows compliance, massive brand
2. **Divya Pathak @ NYC H+H** — Largest public system, huge contract potential
3. **Alda Mizaku @ Children's National** — DC-based, gov-adjacent, pediatric niche
4. **Ben Shahshahani @ Cleveland Clinic** — Tech-forward, greenfield CAIO role
5. **Mouneer Odeh @ Cedars-Sinai** — Building from scratch, LA market
