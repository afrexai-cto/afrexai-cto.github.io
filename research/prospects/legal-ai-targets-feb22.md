# Legal AI Prospects — Feb 22, 2026

## Named Targets (From Research)

### 1. Fisher Phillips (600+ attorneys, 38 US offices)
- **Contact:** Pritesh Patel, Director of Artificial Intelligence (hired from Walmart)
- **Managing Partner:** John Polson
- **Why:** Just created Director of AI role — investing in AI governance + workflows. Labor & employment focus = compliance-heavy. They're building internally but may need implementation acceleration.
- **Angle:** "You hired a Director of AI — but building governance from scratch takes 12+ months. We can accelerate your AI governance framework in weeks, not quarters."
- **ICP Score:** 8 — they're actively investing, right size, compliance-driven vertical

### 2. Innovative Computing Systems (Legal AI Practice Group)
- **Contacts:** Jamie Ormand, Anthony Sorendo (Project Managers, AI Practice Group)
- **Why:** They help small/mid-sized law firms implement AI tools — potential PARTNERSHIP not prospect. They're doing the consulting we do. Either compete or collaborate.
- **Angle:** Partnership — we provide the managed AI workforce, they provide the law firm relationships
- **Type:** Partnership opportunity

### 3. Draftwise (Legal AI vendor)
- **Contact:** Ozan Yalti, Co-Founder
- **Why:** Publicly says "legal industry moved past experimental AI pilots" — could be a referral partner. They sell the tool, we sell the implementation.
- **Angle:** Partnership — "Your clients are stuck going from Draftwise pilot to firm-wide deployment. We're the implementation bridge."
- **Type:** Partnership opportunity
