## Key Intel
- **CHIME 2026 Leadership Pulse Survey** (RLDatix, published today): 90% of healthcare orgs say modernization is essential. Top concern: fragmented technology systems and disconnected data.
- **WittKieffer 2024 survey**: 53% of healthcare CIOs in role ≤3 years. Only 39% have succession plan. HIGH TURNOVER = constant stream of new CIOs needing quick wins.
- Rich Rogers retired as SVP & CIO at Prisma Health (Jan 2026) — LeBlond is his replacement.

## Email Status
- Wootton: Draft ready (batch 3)
- Marlow: Draft ready (batch 3)
