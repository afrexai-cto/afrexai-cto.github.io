# Healthcare Prospects — HHS AI Governance Deadline (April 3, 2026)
*Generated: 2026-02-19 08:56 GMT*

## Urgency: 43 DAYS until HHS mandate requires all divisions to adopt AI governance practices

### New Targets (from Feb 19 research)

| Organization | Contact | Title | Why Now | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AdventHealth | Chief AI Officer (name TBD) | Chief AI Officer | Publicly stated 2026 is "vibes to value" year for AI. Large health system, needs governance framework for HHS compliance | ★★★★★ |
| Claritev | Fernando Schwartz | Chief AI Officer | Already working with Fractional AI on roadmap — may be open to agent deployment partner. Health plans = HHS target | ★★★★ |
| Mount Sinai Health System | Girish N. Nadkarni, MD | Chief AI Officer | Chair of AI & Human Health dept. Building AI at scale across health system. Needs governance for HHS | ★★★★★ |
| Iodine Software | TBD | CTO/CEO | Healthcare AI company working with Fractional AI — validates they're buying AI services. Mid-market | ★★★ |
| Definitive Healthcare | TBD | CTO/CEO | Healthcare data/analytics. Working with AI consultants already. May need agent deployment | ★★★ |

### Competitor Alert: Fractional AI
- **Launched healthcare & life sciences division** (Feb 2026)
- Clients: Claritev, Iodine Software, Definitive Healthcare, Beghou Consulting, Atropos Health
- **Their gap:** Consulting/roadmap only. No agent deployment. No managed service.
- **Our angle:** "They'll tell you what to do. We'll do it." — implementation > strategy

### Pitch Angle for HHS Deadline
"April 3 is 43 days away. The HHS AI governance mandate requires bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security controls, and human oversight across ALL divisions using AI. Most health systems don't even have an inventory of their AI tools, let alone governance. We deploy AI governance agents in 3 weeks — not 3 quarters."

### Email Subject Lines (A/B test)
