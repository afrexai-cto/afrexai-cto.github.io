# Financial Services — New AI Leadership Appointments (Feb 19, 2026)

## Key Signals This Week

### 1. JPMorgan Chase — Guy Halamish, COO of Commercial & Investment Bank
- **Appointed:** Feb 12, 2026
- **Mandate:** Accelerate AI rollout across CIB division
- **Structure:** Each business unit now gets a chief data & analytics officer reporting to Halamish
- **Also hired:** Zachery Anderson as CDAO for Payments division (from AWS, ~6 year tenure)
- **Why it matters:** JPM is restructuring entire CIB around AI. This is the largest bank in the world going all-in.
- **Our angle:** Too big for direct outreach. Use as case study in pitches ("JPM is restructuring around AI — are you?")

### 2. Wells Fargo — Faraz Shafiq, Head of AI Products & Solutions
- **Appointed:** Effective Feb 9, 2026
- **Background:** Former AWS executive
- **Reports to:** Saul Van Beurden, Head of AI and Co-CEO of Consumer Banking
- **Why it matters:** Wells Fargo created a "Head of AI" C-suite role. Former AWS = they're building enterprise-grade.
- **Our angle:** Again, aspirational case study. But their vendors/partners downstream are our targets.

### 3. Market Signal: 70% of Bank CEOs Are Leading AI Personally
- **Source:** BCG survey (American Banker, Feb 19)
- **Key stat:** 54% say job stability depends on getting AI right
- **Spend:** 7 hours/week expanding AI knowledge
- **Our angle:** These CEOs KNOW they need AI but lack implementation teams. Perfect positioning for AfrexAI's managed AI workforce.

### 4. Market Signal: Banks Moving from Chatbots to Autonomous Agents
- **Source:** PYMNTS, Feb 16
- **Key insight:** AI agents now handling AML/KYC investigations, cash flow optimization, payment routing
- **Thomson Reuters analysis:** Workflow orchestration replacing task automation
- **43% of CFOs** expect high impact from agentic AI on dynamic budget reallocation
- **Our angle:** We build exactly this — autonomous AI agents for regulated workflows
