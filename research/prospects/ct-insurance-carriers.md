# Connecticut Insurance Carrier Targets
*Created: 2026-02-15 | Angle: CT SB-2 + Bulletin MC-25 compliance*

## Why Connecticut
- SB-2: Most comprehensive state AI regulation (effective July 1, 2025, cure period ends June 30, 2026)
- Insurance Dept Bulletin MC-25 (Feb 2024): Already requires AI transparency from CT insurers
- Insurance capital of the US — Hartford is home to major carriers
- Carriers HERE feel regulatory pressure FIRST

## Outreach Angle
**Subject line:** "CT SB-2 cure period ends June 30 — is your AI governance ready?"

**Key hooks:**
1. CT Insurance Dept Bulletin MC-25 already mandates AI transparency
2. SB-2 adds developer/deployer obligations with AG enforcement
3. 60-day cure window closing = urgency trigger
4. "3 weeks to compliant AI operations" = our pitch

## Next Steps
- [ ] Identify CIO/CTO/Chief Innovation Officer at each carrier
- [ ] Draft carrier-specific cold emails referencing their lines of business
- [ ] Cross-reference with existing finserv prospect list for overlap
- [ ] Research which carriers have publicly announced AI initiatives (warm targets)
