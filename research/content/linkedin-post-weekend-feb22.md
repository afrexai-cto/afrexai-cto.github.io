78% of enterprises adopted AI in 2024.

Only 15% scaled it beyond a pilot.

That's not a technology problem. That's an implementation problem.

We analyzed the top AI consulting firms serving financial services this week — Neurons Lab, Accenture, Deloitte, BCG, Cognizant, DataRobot.

Here's what we noticed:

→ The generalists (Accenture, Deloitte, BCG) sell AI as part of multi-year digital transformation. Translation: 18 months before you see results.

→ The AI-exclusive firms (Neurons Lab, DataRobot) are faster but still charge enterprise rates and focus on platform deployment.

→ Nobody is offering a managed AI workforce — agents that run your operations daily, with built-in governance, for a fraction of the cost.

That's the gap.

Not another strategy deck. Not another platform license. Actual AI agents doing actual work — compliance screening, document review, claims processing — managed end-to-end.

The firms that figure this out in 2026 won't just save money. They'll structurally outperform everyone who's still "piloting."

If your AI strategy is stuck between "we bought the tools" and "nothing actually changed" — that's exactly where we start.
