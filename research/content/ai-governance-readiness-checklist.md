## Are You Ready for the HHS AI Governance Mandate?

The clock is ticking. By April 3, 2026, all HHS divisions must adopt AI governance practices covering bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security, and human oversight. Healthcare organizations working with federal programs need to align — or risk falling behind.

Here's your 5-minute readiness check.

---

### 1. AI Inventory & Classification
- [ ] We have a complete inventory of all AI/ML systems in use across departments
- [ ] Each AI system is classified by risk level (clinical vs. administrative vs. operational)
- [ ] We know which AI systems touch patient data or clinical decisions
- [ ] Shadow AI usage has been audited (staff using ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)

### 2. Bias Mitigation
- [ ] AI models have been tested for demographic bias (race, age, gender, socioeconomic)
- [ ] We have a documented process for bias testing before deployment
- [ ] Ongoing monitoring is in place for model drift and emerging bias
- [ ] Patient outcomes are tracked by demographic group for AI-assisted decisions

### 3. Human Oversight Framework
- [ ] Clinical AI outputs require human review before action
- [ ] Escalation paths exist when AI recommendations conflict with clinical judgment
- [ ] Staff are trained on when to override AI suggestions
- [ ] Override rates are tracked and reviewed quarterly

### 4. Security & Privacy
- [ ] AI systems comply with HIPAA technical safeguards
- [ ] Data used for AI training/inference is properly de-identified or consented
- [ ] Third-party AI vendors have signed BAAs with AI-specific provisions
- [ ] Incident response plan covers AI-specific failure modes

### 5. Outcome Monitoring
- [ ] KPIs are defined for each AI system (accuracy, false positive/negative rates)
- [ ] Performance is reviewed at least quarterly
- [ ] Underperforming AI systems have a documented remediation or sunset process
- [ ] Patient safety events related to AI are reported and investigated

### 6. Governance Structure
- [ ] A named individual or committee owns AI governance
- [ ] AI governance policies are documented and board-approved
- [ ] New AI deployments go through a formal review/approval process
- [ ] Vendor AI solutions are evaluated against governance criteria before procurement

### 7. Documentation & Audit Trail
- [ ] AI decision rationale is logged for clinical applications
- [ ] Model versions, training data, and validation results are documented
- [ ] Governance activities are audit-ready for CMS/HHS review
- [ ] Annual AI governance report is produced for leadership
