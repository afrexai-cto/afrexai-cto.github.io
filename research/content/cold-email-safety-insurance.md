**Subject:** Massachusetts AI regulation is coming — Safety Insurance's exposure

[Name],

Massachusetts is actively developing AI oversight frameworks for insurance. As Safety's largest market, this hits you first.

Northeast carriers face a unique challenge: you're operating in states with some of the most consumer-protective regulatory environments in the country (MA, CT, NH). Connecticut already has AI transparency requirements moving through the legislature.

We build AI governance frameworks for mid-market carriers — mapping every AI touchpoint across underwriting, claims, and pricing to each state's specific requirements. For a carrier Safety's size, this typically takes 3 weeks, not 3 quarters.

Would it be worth 20 minutes to see what a state-by-state compliance map looks like for your Northeast footprint?

**Subject:** Re: Massachusetts AI regulation

Quick concrete resource — our insurance AI compliance ROI calculator estimates regulatory risk exposure based on premium volume and operating states.

For a $1.1B Northeast carrier, the typical exposure from undocumented AI usage runs $3-5M annually. Most of the risk sits in automated underwriting and claims scoring.

**Subject:** Northeast carriers getting ahead of AI audits

[Name] — Connecticut's AI transparency bill is expected to pass this session. Massachusetts DOI has been in NAIC working groups since 2024.

The carriers preparing now are building their documentation while it's a choice, not a mandate. That's a 3-5x cost difference.

Happy to share our Northeast regulatory timeline.
