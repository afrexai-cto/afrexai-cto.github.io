Last week, Complyance raised $20M from Google Ventures to build AI agents for compliance.

The same week, Harvard Business Review published a blueprint for enterprise-wide agentic AI transformation.

And OpenAI launched Frontier — an entire platform for deploying AI agents in enterprises.

Three signals. One message: AI agents aren't coming. They're here. And the companies that deploy them properly will eat the ones that don't.

But here's the thing nobody's talking about:

Most enterprises don't need another platform. They need someone who can actually make it work.

That's the gap we fill at AfrexAI.

We don't sell tools. We deploy working AI agents that handle real workflows — compliance screening, contract review, claims processing — and we manage them end-to-end.

Think of it this way: OpenAI builds the engine. Google builds the roads. We drive the car.

If your team is drowning in manual compliance work, document review, or data processing — and you're wondering how to actually use AI instead of just talking about it — let's chat.
