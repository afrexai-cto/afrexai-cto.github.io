# Cold Email: Scott Hallworth, CDO at AIG

**Subject:** AIG's AI stack — one question

**Body:**

Scott,

Congrats on the CDO appointment — reporting directly to Peter puts you in a rare position to actually move the needle on AI at scale.

Quick question: how are you thinking about the gap between AI pilots and production deployment across AIG's insurance operations?

We work with carriers to deploy managed AI agent workforces — not chatbots, but agents that actually process claims, triage FNOL, and handle compliance across 50 states. Our clients typically see 60-70% reduction in claims processing time within 90 days.

Given you're building your digital/AI strategy from a strong foundation, I'd love to share what's working for carriers in your tier.

Worth a 15-minute call next week?

Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

**Notes:**
- AIG revenue: $46B. CDO role since Sep 2025, reports to CEO Peter Zaffino since Jan 2026.
- New-in-role = needs quick wins to justify mandate. Perfect timing.
- Don't mention competitors by name. Lead with carrier-specific pain.
- Follow-up Email 2 in 5 days: share insurance one-pager as "thought piece"
- Follow-up Email 3 in 12 days: reference specific AIG initiative if found
