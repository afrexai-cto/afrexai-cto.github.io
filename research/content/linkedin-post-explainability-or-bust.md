"Any decision that materially impacts a customer must be explainable. If a compliance officer cannot articulate why, that outcome should not stand."

That's not from a regulator. That's from fintech operators themselves (fintech.global, Feb 2026).

The AI governance conversation has shifted.

It used to be: "How do we adopt AI faster?"

Now it's: "How do we prove our AI decisions are defensible?"

Three things every financial services firm should have in place by Q2:

1. An explainability framework for every customer-facing AI decision
2. Audit trails that a regulator can actually follow
3. Human oversight protocols that aren't just checkbox exercises

The firms treating AI governance as a "nice to have" are the same ones that'll be scrambling when the first enforcement action drops.

And it will drop. SEC's been clear. State regulators are moving faster (looking at you, Colorado SB-205).

The question isn't whether you need AI governance.

It's whether you'll build it proactively or reactively.
