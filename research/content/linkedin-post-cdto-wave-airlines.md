# LinkedIn Post Draft: The CDTO Wave Hits Aviation

**For:** AfrexAI company page / Christina Beckford
**Topic:** New tech leadership appointments and what they signal

---

Delta just replaced a 10-year CIO with a "Chief Digital & Technology Officer."

Not CIO. Not CTO. CDTO.

That title change tells you everything about where airlines are heading.

Amala Duggirala came from USAA — one of the most AI-forward financial institutions in the US. Delta didn't hire a systems maintainer. They hired someone who's deployed AI agents at scale in a heavily regulated industry.

And she's not alone. In the last 90 days:
→ BioMarin created a brand new CDIO role
→ NCR Atleos appointed a new CTO with an AI mandate  
→ The Oncology Institute brought in a CIO from cloud/AI startups
→ UC San Diego Health created its first Chief Innovation Officer

The pattern is clear: boards are done with "AI strategy decks." They want operators who can show results in 90 days.

The question for every enterprise: do you have the implementation partner to make those results real?

Because the new exec has the mandate. The budget. The board pressure.

What they usually don't have is 90 days of runway to build from scratch.
