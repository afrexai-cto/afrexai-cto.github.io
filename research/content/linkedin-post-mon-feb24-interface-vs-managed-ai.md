## Theme: "Point Solutions vs. AI Operations" (interface.ai counter-positioning)

---

Last week, interface.ai launched TWO products for community banks in 48 hours.

Collections AI. Contact center AI. Both useful. Both narrow.

Here's what caught my eye: they're calling themselves "the definitive leader in Agentic AI for Community Financial Institutions."

Bold claim. But it reveals a pattern.

The industry keeps selling banks AI tools.
One for collections.
One for fraud.
One for call routing.
One for compliance screening.

Know what banks actually need? An AI operations strategy.

CSI's 2026 survey: 27% of community bank leaders say AI is their #1 concern — surpassing cybersecurity for the first time.

They're not worried about which chatbot to buy. They're worried about:
→ How does this fit with our core system?
→ Who governs it when things go wrong?
→ How do we scale past one use case?

NIST just launched an AI Agent Standards Initiative. HHS has an AI governance deadline in April. OCC is running an RFI on CSP-embedded AI risks.

The regulatory walls are going up. Fast.

Point solutions won't survive that. Managed AI operations will.

The banks that figure this out first won't just save money — they'll become the banks everyone else copies.
