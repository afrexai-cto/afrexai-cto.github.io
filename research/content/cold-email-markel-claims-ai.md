# Cold Email: Markel Group — Claims AI Automation

**Target:** Claims / Technology leadership at Markel Group
**Context:** Markel actively partnering with ClaimDeck (1,300 data points/claim), Insurate (AI safety scoring). Already embracing automation in back-office claims. Revenue: ~$16B (Markel Group). Specialty/surplus lines insurer with Ventures arm.
**Angle:** They're collecting structured data but still using it for analytics — not autonomous action. The gap between "AI-ready data" and "AI-driven workflows" is where we come in.
**ACV potential:** $400K-$800K

## Email 1 — Day 1: The Data-to-Action Gap

**Subject:** Markel's 1,300 data points per claim — what's next?

Hi [First Name],

Saw the ClaimDeck partnership — collecting 1,300 structured data points per claim is genuinely impressive. Most carriers we talk to are still fighting unstructured PDFs.

But here's what we keep seeing: carriers build the data foundation, then stall at "now what?" Dashboards and analytics are table stakes. The real unlock is autonomous agents that act on that data — triaging claims, flagging reserves, routing to adjusters — without a human in the loop for routine cases.

We build managed AI agent workforces for specialty insurers. One carrier cut claims processing time by 40% and reduced leakage by $2.3M in the first year.

Worth a 20-minute call to see if Markel's data infrastructure could support that kind of automation?

Best,

## Email 2 — Day 4: The Insurate Connection

**Subject:** Re: Markel's 1,300 data points per claim

Hi [First Name],

One more thought — your Insurate collaboration for workers' comp safety scoring is a perfect example of what we mean by "intelligence at the edge."

The pattern we see working: take the scoring/prediction layer (like Insurate) and connect it to execution agents that automatically adjust pricing, flag high-risk renewals, or trigger loss control outreach. No manual handoff.

We've built these agent workflows for [similar carrier] and the ROI showed up in 90 days.

Happy to share specifics if useful.

## Email 3 — Day 9: Graceful Exit

**Subject:** Re: Markel's 1,300 data points per claim

Hi [First Name],

Don't want to be a pest. If timing's off, totally get it.

Left you a quick guide on how specialty insurers are using AI agents beyond analytics — happy to send it over if helpful, no strings.

Either way, rooting for what you're building at Markel. The data-first approach is rare and smart.

Christina
