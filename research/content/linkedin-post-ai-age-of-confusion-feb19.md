McKinsey has launched tens of thousands of AI agents internally.

And even they're asking: "Is it worth it?"

Business Insider just reported that the world's biggest consulting firms — McKinsey, PwC, EY, BCG — are all scrambling to measure whether their AI investments actually create value.

A former McKinsey partner called it "the age of confusion."

Here's what that means for mid-market companies:

If McKinsey can't figure out AI ROI with unlimited resources...

How is a 500-person financial services firm supposed to?

The answer isn't more AI tools. It's better AI implementation.

The gap isn't technology. It's execution.

→ 95% of AI pilots fail (MIT)
→ 76% of enterprises want to buy AI solutions, not build them
→ Every $1 invested in AI returns $3.70 — but only when it's implemented right

The companies winning with AI right now aren't the ones with the most agents.

They're the ones with agents that actually work.

That's what we do at AfrexAI. Not AI hype. AI that ships.
