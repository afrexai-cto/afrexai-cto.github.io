**To:** Conference organizers / speaker committee

Hi [Name],

We've been helping mid-market insurers stand up AI governance frameworks that actually pass regulatory scrutiny — not 18-month consulting engagements, but functional systems in 3 weeks.

With Colorado's SB 24-205 now live and 6+ states drafting similar bills, every insurer using AI in underwriting or claims is scrambling. Most don't know where to start.

I'd love to present a practical session at Insurance Tech & Innovation:

**"3-Week AI Governance: How Mid-Market Insurers Are Getting Audit-Ready Before Regulators Come Knocking"**

What attendees walk away with:
- A clear map of which state regulations affect their specific AI models
- The 4 documentation gaps that trigger 80% of market conduct findings
- A real implementation timeline (not theory — actual client examples)

We've worked with carriers writing $200M–$2B in premiums across P&C and specialty lines. Happy to share references.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to discuss the speaker track?

Best,
[AfrexAI Team]
