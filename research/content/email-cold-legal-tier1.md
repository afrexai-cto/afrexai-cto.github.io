## Email 1 — The Opener

Subject: {subject_A}

Hi {first_name},

Saw your work on AI adoption at {firm_name} — you're clearly ahead of most firms on this.

But here's what I keep hearing from innovation leads at Am Law 100 firms: the gap between "experimenting with AI" and "AI that actually does the work" is massive.

We close that gap. AfrexAI deploys autonomous AI agents — contract review, due diligence, compliance monitoring — that integrate into your existing workflows. Not chatbots. Not copilots. Agents that complete tasks end-to-end.

One firm went from 3,000 daily prompts to full autonomous contract review in 6 weeks.

Would a 15-minute demo be worth your time this week? We'll show you a working agent built around a real legal workflow — no slides, no pitch deck.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — The Follow-Up (Day 3)

Subject: Re: {subject_A}

Hi {first_name},

Quick follow-up — I know inboxes are brutal.

One thing I didn't mention: 40% of enterprise AI projects get canceled within 18 months (Gartner, Feb 2026). The #1 reason? Bad implementation, not bad technology.

That's literally what we solve. We build, deploy, and manage the agents. Your team focuses on practicing law.

Happy to share a 2-minute case study if that's easier than a call.

Christina

## Email 3 — The Breakup (Day 7)

Subject: Should I close this out?

Hi {first_name},

I'll keep this short — I know you're busy, and I don't want to clutter your inbox.

If AI agent deployment isn't a priority right now, totally understand. But if your firm is spending $200K+/attorney on work that AI can handle, and you want to see what "actually deployed" looks like — I'm here.

Either way, I'll stop following up after this one.

|--------|---------------------|
| Wilson Sonsini (Anni Datesh) | "Saw your Legalweek panel — your take on AI governance was spot-on" |
| Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer (Ilona Logvinova) | "Building an AI strategy from scratch is exciting — and terrifying. We've done it 15+ times." |
| Shook Hardy (Veronica Gromada) | "3,000 prompts/day is impressive. But prompts aren't agents — want to see the difference?" |
| Goodwin Procter (Eric Tan) | "Your Jan article said AI is table stakes. We agree — but most firms are still at the appetizer." |
