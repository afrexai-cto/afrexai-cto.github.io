## Email 1 — Day 1: The HHS Deadline

**Subject:** April 3 is 47 days away — is {Company}'s AI governance ready?

**Body:**

{FirstName},

The HHS mandate landing April 3 requires every division to have AI governance practices in place — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security controls, human oversight documentation.

Most health systems we talk to have the *intent* but not the *infrastructure*. They've got a policy doc and a prayer.

We build AI agents that come with governance baked in — audit trails, bias detection, human-in-the-loop controls. Not theory. Working systems that satisfy HHS requirements on day one.

One of our implementations cut clinical documentation time by 62% while *improving* compliance scores. The ROI case writes itself when you're solving two problems at once.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if we can help {Company} hit the deadline without the fire drill?

## Email 2 — Day 4: The Labor Math

**Subject:** Re: April 3 is 47 days away

**Body:**

{FirstName},

Following up — wanted to share a number that usually gets attention.

The average health system spends $12M-$18M/year on clinical documentation alone (salary, overtime, locum coverage for admin burden). AI agents handling prior auth, clinical notes, and claims processing typically recover 30-40% of that.

That's $4M-$7M back — not in "efficiency gains" that never materialize, but in actual headcount you don't need to hire in a market where RN turnover is 18% and traveling nurses cost 3x.

We're not selling software. We're selling the equivalent of 40-60 FTEs that never call in sick, never burn out, and come with HHS-compliant governance out of the box.

Happy to walk through the math specific to {Company}'s scale.

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Email 3 — Day 9: The Graceful Exit

**Subject:** Re: April 3 is 47 days away

**Body:**

{FirstName},

Last note — I know timing is everything in healthcare IT.

If AI agent implementation isn't on the roadmap right now, no worries. I put together a free **HHS AI Governance Readiness Checklist** that maps the April 3 requirements to concrete technical controls. Useful even if you're building in-house.

Want me to send it over?

Either way, if the conversation makes sense down the road, I'm easy to find.

## Sequence Notes
- **Hook:** HHS April 3, 2026 deadline creates genuine urgency — not manufactured
- **Variables:** {FirstName}, {Company}, {Role}
- **Vertical stats:** 18% RN turnover, $12-18M doc costs, 95%+ retention once implemented
- **CTA progression:** Call → Math walkthrough → Free checklist (graceful exit)
- **Tone:** Direct, numbers-driven, no AI buzzwords. Healthcare buyers are skeptical — lead with compliance + cost.
- **Important:** Do NOT send without explicit approval from Kalin. Draft only.
