# Competitive Intel: Complyance ($20M Series A, Feb 11 2026)

## What they do
- Agentic AI for enterprise GRC (governance, risk, compliance)
- Deploying 30+ new agents for TPRM, HIPAA, ISO, NIST in 2026
- Led by GV (Google Ventures)

## How AfrexAI differs
- **They**: Platform/SaaS product — one-size-fits-all agents
- **Us**: Custom-built, managed AI workforce — tailored to each client's workflows
- **They**: $20M raised, VC-backed, will burn cash scaling
- **Us**: Bootstrapped, profitable from client 1, no dilution
- **They**: GRC-only focus
- **Us**: Full operational AI — compliance + revenue ops + document processing + customer service

## Implications for AfrexAI
1. **Market validation**: GV putting $20M into AI compliance agents = the market is REAL
2. **Positioning opportunity**: "Complyance gives you agents. We give you YOUR agents." — custom > generic
3. **Sales angle**: When prospects mention Complyance, say "Great for standard frameworks. But your compliance workflows aren't standard, are they?"
4. **Urgency**: If VCs are funding competitors, the window to establish relationships with enterprise buyers is NOW — before they default to funded platforms
