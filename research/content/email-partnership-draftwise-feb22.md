Ozan,

Read your comment about the industry shifting from pilots to production. We're seeing the same thing from the implementation side.

Here's what we keep hearing from mid-size firms: they buy great tools like Draftwise, then struggle to integrate them into actual workflows across the firm. The tool works. The adoption doesn't.

AfrexAI builds managed AI workforces for mid-market firms — we handle the implementation, governance, and ongoing operations that turn point solutions into firm-wide productivity gains.

The fit is straightforward: you sell the drafting intelligence, we deploy it alongside autonomous agents that handle the surrounding workflow — document routing, compliance checks, intake automation. Your customers get more value from Draftwise. You get stickier accounts and lower churn.

Would it make sense to explore a referral or co-implementation arrangement? Our CEO Christina Beckford could walk through a couple of use cases — https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
Kalin Smolichki
CTO, AfrexAI
