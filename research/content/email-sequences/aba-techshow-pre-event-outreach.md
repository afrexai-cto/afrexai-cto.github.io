**Subject:** Heading to TECHSHOW? Quick question about your AI strategy

Hi [Name],

I noticed [firm] has been [specific AI initiative or innovation mention]. We've been helping firms like yours turn AI pilots into production agents that actually save billable hours.

Are you heading to ABA TECHSHOW in March? We're exploring the legal AI space and I'd love to grab 15 minutes — coffee's on us.

Either way, we put together a quick breakdown of what's working vs. failing in legal AI deployments. Happy to share if useful.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

### Email 2 — Send Mar 4 (3 weeks out)
**Subject:** What 3 Am Law 200 firms got wrong with AI (and how to avoid it)

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up — we just published a case analysis of why 95% of AI pilots in law firms fail to reach production.

The short version: most firms buy a platform when they need a workforce.

We help firms deploy AI agents that handle contract review, due diligence, and compliance monitoring — managed end-to-end, so your attorneys focus on billable work.

Would a 15-min chat at TECHSHOW be worth it? I can work around your schedule.

### Email 3 — Send Mar 18 (1 week out)
**Subject:** See you at TECHSHOW next week?

Hi [Name],

Last note before the conference — we'll be at TECHSHOW all three days. If your calendar has a gap, I'd love to show you a quick demo of our contract review agent. Takes 5 minutes, saves firms 40+ hours/week.

No pitch, just a live walkthrough. If it's not relevant, you'll know in 2 minutes.

Reply with a time that works, or just flag me down at the expo.

Looking forward to it,
Christina

### Email 4 — Send Mar 31 (post-event follow-up)
**Subject:** Great connecting at TECHSHOW — next steps

Hi [Name],

Good to connect at TECHSHOW. As promised, here's [the case study / demo link / resource discussed].

If you're evaluating AI implementation partners this quarter, we should talk before you commit. We've seen firms save $200K+ annually with managed AI agents — and we can show ROI in the first 30 days.

Worth a 20-minute call this week?
