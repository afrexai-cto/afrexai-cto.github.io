# InsurTech Spring NYC (Mar 30-31) — Pre-Event Outreach Sequence

## Email 1 — "Attending InsurTech Spring?" (Send: Mar 2, 28 days out)

**Subject:** Quick question about InsurTech Spring

Hey [First Name],

Saw you'll be at InsurTech Spring in NYC — us too.

We've been building AI agents that handle claims intake, underwriting triage, and compliance checks for carriers. Not chatbots — actual autonomous workflows that cut processing time 60-70%.

One carrier we work with went from 11-minute average resolution to under 2 minutes on routine claims.

Would love 15 minutes at the event to show you what that looks like for [Company]. Happy to buy the coffee.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — Value drop (Send: Mar 16, 14 days out)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about InsurTech Spring

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up — we just published a breakdown of how AI agents are cutting claims processing costs by $3.1M annually at mid-market carriers.

Here's the one-pager: [link to insurance one-pager]

The math: 3 AI agents replacing 47,000 hours of manual work = 8.6x ROI on a $360K annual spend.

Still hoping to connect at InsurTech Spring. Our calendar's open March 30-31.

## Email 3 — Social proof + urgency (Send: Mar 25, 5 days out)

**Subject:** See you Monday?

[First Name],

InsurTech Spring is next week. We're booking our last few meetings — wanted to make sure [Company] was on the list.

We've helped firms cut compliance review time from weeks to hours. Happy to walk through the specifics for your team.

15 minutes. No pitch deck. Just a live demo of an AI agent processing a real claim.

Worth a coffee?
