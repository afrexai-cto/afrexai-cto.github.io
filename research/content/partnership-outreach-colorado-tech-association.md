## Email Draft

**To:** CTA partnerships/content team
**Subject:** Free SB-205 compliance resource for your members

Hi [Name],

With Colorado's SB-205 AI governance law now in enforcement, a lot of tech companies are scrambling to figure out what "algorithmic impact assessments" actually mean for their products.

We built a free 50-point SB-205 Compliance Readiness Assessment that helps companies score where they stand across five key areas: AI inventory, impact assessments, consumer notification, governance frameworks, and audit trails. Takes about 15 minutes, and most companies find gaps they didn't know they had.

Would CTA be open to featuring this as a resource for members? Happy to write a companion article walking through the top 5 compliance mistakes Colorado companies are making.

No strings attached on the assessment — we just want to make sure CO companies don't get caught flat-footed.

Best,
