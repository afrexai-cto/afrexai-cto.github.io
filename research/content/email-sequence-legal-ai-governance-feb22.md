## Email 1: "58% of law firms adopted AI. How many can pass an audit?"
**Send: Wednesday Feb 26 | Subject line as above**

Hi [First Name],

58% of legal firms have now adopted AI tools — contract review, e-discovery, compliance checks. That number doubled in 18 months.

But here's the problem nobody's talking about: the ABA and state bars are publishing AI ethics guidance faster than firms can implement it. Florida Bar just updated their rules. New York's not far behind. NIST launched an AI Agent Standards Initiative three days ago.

Most firms bolted on AI tools without governance. No audit trail. No bias documentation. No client data isolation. That's not a technology problem — it's a liability.

We help mid-market law firms deploy AI agents that are built for governance from day one. Not another SaaS login. Working agents that handle document review, compliance monitoring, and client intake — with full audit trails and ethics-compliant architecture.

Our CEO Christina Beckford would be happy to walk through what this looks like for a firm your size. 15 minutes, no pitch deck.

## Email 2: "The Florida Bar just changed the rules" (Follow-up Day 7)
**Subject: Quick follow-up — bar association AI rules**

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on my note last week. Since then, two more state bars published AI disclosure requirements for attorneys.

The pattern is clear: AI governance in legal is moving from "best practice" to "mandatory." Firms that built governance in from the start won't notice. Firms that didn't are looking at remediation costs — and potential malpractice exposure.

We've built implementation playbooks specifically for 50-500 attorney firms. Takes about 3 weeks to get your first AI agents running with full compliance documentation.

Worth a conversation?

## Email 3: "What JPMorgan learned about AI governance" (Follow-up Day 14)
**Subject: How the big firms handle AI compliance**

Hi [First Name],

JPMorgan deployed AI agents for KYC/AML with full governance baked in. They spent millions building that infrastructure internally.

Mid-market firms don't have that budget. But you face the same regulatory expectations. The gap between what regulators require and what most firms have built is where liability lives.

We bridge that gap. Three weeks from kickoff to working AI agents with audit trails, data isolation, and ethics documentation that satisfies bar requirements.

Happy to share specifics on how this works for firms like yours.
