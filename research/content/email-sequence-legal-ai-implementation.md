## Email 1 — The Wake-Up (Day 0)

**Subject:** Baker McKenzie just cut 1,000 staff. Your firm is next (or leading).

Hi {first_name},

Baker McKenzie laid off up to 1,000 support staff last week. The reason? AI made their roles redundant.

Meanwhile, 80% of lawyers now use AI in their practice (Clio Legal Trends 2026) — up 60% in two years.

The firms that win aren't the ones buying chatbots. They're the ones deploying AI agents that actually DO the work — contract review, due diligence, compliance monitoring — autonomously.

We build and manage those agents for Am Law firms. No hallucination risk. No 18-month integration project. Working agents in your workflows within 3 weeks.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits {firm_name}'s roadmap?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — The Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: How firms are cutting doc review time 70%

{first_name},

Quick follow-up with specifics.

One thing we keep hearing from legal innovation leads: the gap isn't in buying AI tools — it's in making them actually work reliably at scale.

That's exactly where we sit. Our AI agents handle:
- **Contract review & extraction** — 70% faster, flagging non-standard clauses autonomously
- **Regulatory monitoring** — agents tracking state-by-state compliance changes daily
- **Due diligence** — structured data extraction from thousands of documents

Every agent comes with human-in-the-loop checkpoints. No hallucinated case citations. No unsupervised outputs.

Gartner says 40% of enterprise AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027. We exist to make sure yours isn't one of them.

Happy to share a 2-page overview specific to {firm_name}'s practice areas.

## Email 3 — The Breakup (Day 9)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

{first_name},

I'll keep this short — I know your inbox is a warzone.

If AI agent implementation isn't a priority for {firm_name} right now, totally understood. But if you're evaluating options for 2026, two things worth knowing:

1. We offer a "Week I Win" guarantee — working demo in your environment within 7 days, or we walk.
2. We've built agents for regulated industries (financial services, healthcare) where accuracy isn't optional.

Either way, I'll stop clogging your inbox. If timing changes, we're at afrexai.com.

All the best,
Christina

## Personalization Notes by Target

### Wilson Sonsini (Anni Datesh, CIO)
- Hook: "You're already speaking at Legalweek about AI — we'd love to be the team behind your next deployment"
- Tech-native firm, skip the evangelism, go straight to implementation details

### Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer (Ilona Logvinova, Chief AI Officer)
- Hook: "Building a Chief AI Officer function from scratch is hard. We can be your implementation layer while you build internally."
- She's ex-McKinsey — speak in frameworks and ROI

### Shook Hardy & Bacon (3,000+ AI prompts/day)
- Hook: "3,000 prompts a day is impressive. But prompts ≠ agents. What if those workflows ran autonomously?"
- Product liability = massive doc review workload

### Goodwin Procter (Eric Tan, CDTO)
- Hook: "Your team said AI is 'table stakes.' We agree. Let's move from table stakes to deployed agents."
- Reference their own published article from Jan 2026

### Dorsey & Whitney (just fell from Am Law 100)
- Hook: "Tech-driven efficiency could be your edge back into the Am Law 100."
- Competitive pressure angle — they need differentiation
