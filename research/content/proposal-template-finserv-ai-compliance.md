## [CLIENT NAME] — AI Regulatory Compliance Program

**Prepared by:** AfrexAI | ai-governance@afrexai.com
**Date:** [DATE]
**Valid for:** 30 days

---

## Executive Summary

[CLIENT NAME] uses AI/ML in [credit decisioning / fraud detection / KYC-AML / customer engagement / underwriting — customize]. Colorado SB 24-205 (effective Feb 2026, enforcement June 30, 2026) requires documented governance, bias auditing, and consumer transparency for all high-risk AI systems in financial services.

AfrexAI delivers production-ready AI compliance in **3 weeks** — before the AG starts requesting documentation. No Big 4 timeline. No Big 4 price.

## The Regulatory Landscape

| Regulation | Deadline | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Colorado SB 24-205 (AI Act) | Enforcement June 30, 2026 | AI in lending, insurance, employment must be auditable |
| CFPB Adverse Action AI Rules | Active enforcement | AI credit denials require explainable reasoning |
| SEC AI Marketing Rules | 2026 | AI in investment recommendations/marketing |
| State AI Laws (IL, CT, TX) | Rolling 2026-2027 | Expanding bias audit requirements |
| EU AI Act (US impact) | 2026 | Global firms need cross-border compliance |

**Risk of non-compliance:** AG investigation with 90 days notice (CO), CFPB enforcement actions, class-action bias litigation, reputational damage, loss of banking charter.

## Proposed Engagement

### Phase 1: AI System Inventory & Risk Classification (Week 1)
- Catalog all AI/ML models in production (credit, fraud, pricing, marketing)
- Classify by SB 24-205 risk tier (high-risk = consequential decisions)
- Map data inputs, decision logic, and override mechanisms
- Identify consumer notification gaps
- **Deliverable:** AI System Registry + Risk Classification Matrix

### Phase 2: Compliance Framework & Bias Audit (Week 2)
- Design governance framework meeting SB 24-205, CFPB, and state requirements
- Conduct initial bias audit on high-risk models (demographic parity, equalized odds)
- Build consumer disclosure templates (adverse action + AI transparency notices)
- Establish model monitoring and drift detection protocols
- **Deliverable:** Governance Framework + Bias Audit Report + Disclosure Templates

### Phase 3: Documentation, Training & Go-Live (Week 3)
- Produce audit-ready documentation package (AG-requestable within 90 days)
- Train compliance and data science teams on ongoing governance
- Set up quarterly bias re-testing cadence
- Establish incident response protocol for AI-related complaints
- **Deliverable:** Complete Compliance Package + Training Materials + Monitoring Dashboard Spec

## Investment

| Component | Price |
|---|---|
| 3-Week AI Compliance Implementation | $200,000 |
| Ongoing Monitoring & Quarterly Bias Audits | $18,000/month |
| Annual Compliance Refresh (regulation updates) | $45,000/year |

**For comparison:** Big 4 consultancies quote $600K-$1.5M for similar scope over 4-6 months. We deliver in 3 weeks at 70%+ savings.

## Why AfrexAI

- **Speed:** 3 weeks, not 6 months. Your AG documentation deadline won't wait.
- **Specialization:** We only do AI governance. Not ERP. Not cybersecurity. AI compliance.
- **Practical:** We build what survives audits, not what looks good in slide decks.
- **Cross-regulatory:** One framework covers SB 24-205, CFPB, SEC, and state laws simultaneously.

## ROI Justification

| Scenario | Cost |
|---|---|
| CFPB enforcement action (fair lending) | $5M-$50M+ |
| Colorado AG investigation + remediation | $500K-$5M |
| Class-action bias lawsuit (lending/insurance) | $10M-$100M+ |
| Reputational damage (news cycle) | Unquantifiable |
| **AfrexAI implementation** | **$200K** |

The compliance program pays for itself if it prevents a single regulatory inquiry.
