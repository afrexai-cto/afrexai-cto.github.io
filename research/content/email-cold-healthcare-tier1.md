## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)

### Subject Line Options (A/B test):
- A: "Goldman Sachs just deployed AI agents for compliance — here's what that means for {{org}}"
- B: "{{first_name}}, quick question about {{org}}'s AI roadmap"
- C: "The $2.4M problem most health systems don't see coming"

### Body:

Hi {{first_name}},

Goldman Sachs just went live with autonomous AI agents handling their compliance and accounting workflows — built on the same Claude models we use.

That's Wall Street. But healthcare has the same problem, arguably worse: {{personalized_hook}}

We've been building AI agent teams that handle clinical documentation compliance, claims processing QA, and regulatory reporting. Not chatbots. Actual autonomous workflows that run 24/7.

The math is straightforward: a 200-bed system typically spends $1.2M-$2.4M annually on compliance administration. Our agents handle 60-70% of that volume at a fraction of the cost.

Would it make sense to show you how this works? I can have a working demo configured for {{org}}'s specific workflows within a week.

Best,
Christina Beckford

### Personalization Hooks:

**Jim Roeder (Lakewood):**
"Rural health systems like Lakewood are expected to meet the same compliance standards as a $5B system — with a fraction of the staff. That gap is only growing."

**Michael Archuleta (Mt. San Rafael):**
"You've already proven AI works for radiology at Mt. San Rafael. The same approach — AI handling high-volume, rules-based work — applies to compliance documentation and claims processing."

**Connie Barrera (Jackson Health):**
"Jackson Health's AI-powered appointment rescheduling already proved the ROI. Compliance workflows are the next logical step — same security-first approach, bigger savings."

**Crystal Broj (MUSC):**
"Academic health systems generate mountains of data but most of the compliance processing is still manual. That's a gap your digital transformation mandate can close fast."

**Dusanka Delovska-Trajkova (Ingleside):**
"Senior care facilities face the most acute staffing crisis in healthcare. AI agents for intake documentation, family communication, and CMS compliance reporting free your team for resident care."

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 3)

### Subject: "Re: {{original_subject}}"

Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to share something concrete since my last note.

Here's what AI agents are actually doing in healthcare compliance right now:

**Before AI agents:**
- Manual chart reviews: 45 min per case
- Coding accuracy: 82-88%
- Denial rate: 8-12%
- Staff overtime: 15-20 hrs/week for compliance

**After AI agents:**
- Automated pre-review: 3 min per case
- Coding accuracy: 94-97% (AI flags + human confirms)
- Denial rate: 3-5%
- Staff freed for exception-only review

These aren't projections — this is what autonomous agents deliver when properly configured for healthcare workflows.

We guarantee a working demo within 7 days of kickoff. If it doesn't work, you owe us nothing.

Worth 15 minutes to explore?

## Email 3: The Breakup (Day 7)

### Subject: "closing the loop — {{org}}"

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple times about AI agents for {{org}}'s compliance workflows. Totally understand if the timing's off.

I'll leave you with this: the health systems moving on AI compliance now are locking in 18-24 months of competitive advantage. The ones waiting will be playing catch-up when CMS tightens automated reporting requirements in 2027.

If this becomes relevant down the road, my inbox is always open.

All the best,
Christina
