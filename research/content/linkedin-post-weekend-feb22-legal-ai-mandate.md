Singapore just told its lawyers: adopt AI or get left behind.

Budget 2026 includes 400% tax deductions for AI tools, free premium subscriptions, and a dedicated Champions of AI programme — specifically naming legal as one of the FIRST professions needing AI transition support.

Meanwhile in the US:
→ 87% of General Counsel say risk is accelerating faster than they can hire (FTI/Relativity)
→ Firms are cutting 16-hour complaint responses to 4 minutes with AI agents
→ Even Skadden's former chairman says "AI will define law firm profitability in 2026"

The pattern is clear: governments and industry leaders are done waiting for law firms to figure it out on their own.

The firms that implement NOW get structural advantage. The ones that wait become case studies in what not to do.

We help legal teams deploy AI agents that actually work — not chatbots, not demos, but managed AI workforces handling real billable work.

If your firm is still "evaluating AI" in 2026, the evaluation is already the answer.
