Hi Rohan,

Congrats on the CIO appointment at Atleos. Saw the announcement about driving AI-led automation — makes sense given where self-service banking is heading.

New CIOs usually inherit a backlog of "AI projects" that never shipped. The pattern we see: lots of PoCs, no production deployments, team stretched thin across too many initiatives.

We deploy managed AI agents for financial services and fintech infrastructure companies. Not consultants who hand you a deck — actual working agents that handle things like transaction monitoring, compliance screening, and ops automation. Typical deployment: 3 weeks to production, not 6 months.

If you're still mapping out priorities, happy to share what's working at similar scale companies. 20 minutes — no pitch deck, just patterns.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
