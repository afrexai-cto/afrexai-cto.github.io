# Healthcare AI Agent Deployment — Proposal Template
*AfrexAI | Managed AI Workforce for Healthcare Organizations*

## The Problem

US healthcare wastes **$265 billion annually** on administrative complexity. Your clinical and operations staff are drowning in documentation, prior authorizations, and compliance tracking while patient volume keeps climbing:

- Physicians spend **49% of their time** on paperwork, not patients
- Prior authorization denials cost the average health system **$11M/year** in rework and lost revenue
- HHS AI transparency mandates take effect **April 3, 2026** — non-compliance = CMS payment risk
- Revenue cycle leakage averages **3-5% of net patient revenue** ($6-10M for a mid-size system)

You can't hire enough coders, billers, and compliance analysts. You need AI agents that work 24/7 alongside the staff you have.

## What We Deploy

AfrexAI deploys a managed AI workforce — autonomous agents that handle the administrative burden crushing your operations teams.

### Agent 1: Revenue Cycle Agent
- Monitors claim submissions and flags coding errors before they become denials
- Auto-generates appeal letters for denied claims using payer-specific logic
- Tracks underpayments against contracted rates — surfaces missed revenue daily
- **Impact:** Reduces denial rate by 30-40%, recovers $2-4M/year in missed revenue

### Agent 2: Prior Authorization Agent
- Pulls clinical documentation from EHR to auto-populate auth requests
- Tracks submission status across all payers — escalates stalled requests
- Flags patients at risk of care delays due to pending auths
- **Impact:** Cuts auth turnaround from 5-14 days to <48 hours, reduces staff time by 60%

### Agent 3: Compliance & Regulatory Agent
- Monitors CMS, HHS, and state regulatory updates in real-time
- Maps new requirements to your current policies — flags gaps
- Generates board-ready compliance reports monthly
- Tracks HHS AI transparency mandate readiness (April 3 deadline)
- **Impact:** Eliminates compliance surprises, reduces audit prep from weeks to hours

### Agent 4: Patient Operations Agent
- Monitors appointment no-show patterns — triggers smart outreach
- Tracks patient satisfaction signals across surveys and reviews
- Flags operational bottlenecks (wait times, bed turnover, staffing gaps)
- **Impact:** Reduces no-shows by 25-30%, improves throughput without adding headcount

## HIPAA & Security

- All agents run on **dedicated infrastructure** (not shared/multi-tenant)
- **No PHI stored** in agent memory — agents query your systems in real-time
- BAA available — we sign before any data access
- SOC 2 Type II compliance roadmap (Q3 2026)
- All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256)

## Next Steps

1. **30-minute discovery call** — map your highest-impact use case
2. **Week 1 deployment** — one agent live, processing real data
3. **14-day proof of value** — measurable results before you commit
