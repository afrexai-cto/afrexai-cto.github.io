## Email 1: The 16-Hour Gap

**Subject:** Your AI is probably only working 8 hours a day

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: when your team goes home at 6 PM, does your AI?

Most enterprise AI deployments are still tethered to human schedules — chatbots that wait for questions, dashboards that need someone looking at them, automations that run on business-hours cron jobs.

Meanwhile, Capital One just embedded multi-agent AI directly into live operations. Not a pilot. Not a lab project. Production systems running autonomously around the clock.

The companies pulling ahead in 2026 aren't just using AI. They're deploying AI workforces that operate 24/7 — processing compliance reports overnight, triaging inbound before anyone logs in, flagging anomalies at 3 AM.

We help mid-market companies close that gap. Not with another dashboard. With managed AI agents that actually run your operations.

Worth a 15-minute call to see what your specific 16-hour gap looks like?

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Email 2: The Architecture Problem (Send Day +5)

**Subject:** Re: Your AI is probably only working 8 hours a day

Hi [First Name],

One thing I didn't mention last time: the reason most AI deployments stall isn't the technology. It's the architecture.

Stanford's latest data: 78% of enterprises adopted AI. Only 15% successfully scaled beyond pilots.

That 63% gap? Almost always the same root cause — AI was bolted onto existing workflows instead of built into operations.

The shift from "AI assistant" to "AI operator" isn't a software upgrade. It's a rearchitecture. And the companies doing it right are seeing 40-60% cost reductions in back-office operations.

We've built the playbook for mid-market companies that want enterprise-grade AI operations without the enterprise-grade price tag.

Happy to share what we're seeing in [their industry] specifically.

## Email 3: The Deadline (Send Day +10)

**Subject:** NIST just made this urgent

Hi [First Name],

Quick update: NIST launched their AI Agent Standards Initiative on Feb 20. Federal governance standards for autonomous AI agents are coming — fast.

For companies already running AI agents in production, this is validation.

For companies still in pilot mode, it's a deadline. Because retrofitting governance into AI systems costs 3-5x more than building it in from day one.

We build governance into every AI agent deployment from the start. It's not an add-on — it's how the system works.

If AI governance is even on your radar for 2026, this is worth 15 minutes.
