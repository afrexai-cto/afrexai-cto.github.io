Aubrey,

Caught your recent Passle CMO Series interview and the Axios piece. You made a point that stuck with me — the gap between firms experimenting with AI and firms actually operationalizing it.

We're seeing the same thing. Our team builds managed AI agent workforces for Am Law firms — not chatbots, not copilots, actual autonomous agents that handle contract review, due diligence triage, and compliance monitoring end-to-end.

Quick context: we helped a $111K engagement deploy working AI agents in under 7 days. Not a pilot. Not a POC. Production workflows.

The reason I'm reaching out: V&E sits at the intersection of energy, finance, and PE — all sectors where regulatory complexity is accelerating faster than headcount can scale. Curious whether your innovation team has looked at managed agent deployment vs. building internally.

Happy to share what's working for firms in your peer group. No pitch deck, just a 15-minute conversation.
