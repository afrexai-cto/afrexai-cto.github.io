# LinkedIn Post: Insurance Giants Are Deploying AI Agents in the Back Office

Insurance companies aren't just "exploring AI" anymore.

They're deploying agentic AI systems that process claims intake, route exceptions, trigger payments, and handle policy servicing — autonomously.

Microsoft and Cognizant just published their joint framework for agentic AI adoption in insurance. The systems ingest unstructured emails, scanned PDFs, and intake forms. They extract coverage info, apply policy rules, and only escalate to humans when it actually matters.

This isn't the chatbot wave. This is AI doing the work.

But here's what most insurers are discovering the hard way:

The technology isn't the hard part. Governance is.

Colorado SB 24-205 hits June 30. State-level AI regulations are multiplying. And the carriers deploying agents without governance frameworks are building liability, not efficiency.

We've helped regulated companies deploy AI agents with built-in compliance guardrails — not as an afterthought, but as the architecture.

If you're in insurance and your AI governance plan is still a PDF on someone's desktop, we should talk.
