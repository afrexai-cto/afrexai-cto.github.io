## Version A — Direct

**Subject:** WorkFusion just got acquired. What's your Plan B?

Hi {{first_name}},

UiPath closed the WorkFusion acquisition on Feb 6. For mid-market firms like {{company}}, that usually means one thing: your compliance tools are about to get more expensive and less focused.

UiPath is an enterprise platform company. They'll fold WorkFusion into their broader stack, raise prices, and shift R&D priorities to their biggest accounts.

We built AfrexAI specifically for this moment. Purpose-built AI agents for compliance — KYC screening, AML monitoring, regulatory reporting — without the enterprise bloat or acquisition risk.

Three things that might matter to you:
- **Week 1 demo**: Working agent on your actual data in 7 days
- **70% cost reduction** vs enterprise platforms
- **No lock-in**: You own the agents, the data, and the workflows

Worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Version B — Softer / Consultative

**Subject:** Quick thought on the UiPath-WorkFusion news

Hi {{first_name}},

Saw the UiPath-WorkFusion acquisition close last week. Having worked with several mid-market compliance teams through transitions like this, I wanted to flag something.

The usual playbook after an acquisition: 6-12 months of "nothing changes," then gradual price increases and feature consolidation into the parent platform. For teams running lean compliance operations, that can be disruptive.

We've been helping firms like {{company}} build independent AI compliance agents — ones you own and control, no platform dependency. Happy to share what we're seeing in the market if it's useful.

No pitch, just perspective.
