# LinkedIn Post — Construction AI (Sunday Feb 22, 2026)

Construction loses $177 billion a year to coordination failures.

Not material costs. Not labor rates. Pure waste from fragmented workflows — schedules that don't talk to submittals, change orders lost between systems, safety data sitting in spreadsheets nobody reads until after the incident.

Here's what's shifting in 2026:

AI agents are moving from pilot to production on real job sites. Not chatbots. Autonomous systems that coordinate across Procore, BIM 360, and your subcontractor ecosystem 24/7.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that construction firms are deploying AI agents to solve coordination problems that have plagued the industry for decades.

The market is projected to hit $6 billion by 2034. But here's the catch — 95% of AI projects never make it past the pilot phase.

The gap isn't technology. It's implementation.

Mid-market contractors don't need another SaaS dashboard. They need someone who's done this before to deploy agents that actually work with their existing stack.

That's the business we're building at AfrexAI.

If you're a GC or construction exec thinking about AI but stuck on where to start — happy to share what we're seeing work.
