*Draft for ksmolichki@afrexai.com — DO NOT SEND without approval*

**To:** Selvam Ratinasabapati, Global CIO, W.R. Berkley Corporation
**Subject:** Berkley's AI exclusion strategy + internal AI governance gap

Selvam,

Berkley's move to exclude AI-related losses from D&O policies was one of the sharper plays I've seen — most carriers are still pretending the liability doesn't exist.

But here's the tension: you're excluding AI risk for your insureds while simultaneously deploying AI across your own 60+ operating units. Underwriting models, claims automation, pricing algorithms — all the things that fall squarely under CT SB-2's developer/deployer obligations.

With enforcement active and the cure window closing June 30, the question isn't whether Berkley uses AI. It's whether Berkley's own AI governance is as rigorous as the exclusion language suggests it should be for others.

We help carriers build operational AI governance — not compliance paperwork, but auditable systems that hold up under examination. Given the decentralized nature of Berkley's operating model (60+ units, each with their own tech stacks), the governance challenge is uniquely complex.

Worth a 20-minute call to compare notes? Happy to share the 2-page governance framework we've been using with CT-domiciled carriers.

Best,
[AfrexAI signature]

**Why this works:**
- Opens with genuine respect for their AI exclusion strategy (verifiable, Dec 2025 news)
- Creates cognitive dissonance: "you exclude AI risk for others but what about YOUR AI?"
- Selvam is Global CIO since 2023 (NYU Stern, digital transformation background)
- Berkley HQ in Greenwich, CT — directly subject to CT SB-2
- 60+ operating units = massive governance coordination challenge = big engagement
- References the 2-page framework deliverable (now built)
- **Potential ACV: $500K-$1M+** (60+ units, Fortune 500, complex governance)

**Key intel:**
- W.R. Berkley: $12.7B revenue, Greenwich CT HQ, 60+ operating units
- Proposed AI exclusions from D&O policies (Oct-Dec 2025) — industry-leading position
- Selvam Ratinasabapati: Global CIO since ~2023, NYU Stern, digital transformation exec
- Decentralized operating model makes enterprise-wide AI governance especially hard
