# AI Compliance in 3 Weeks — Financial Services One-Pager

## The Problem

Colorado SB 24-205 is live February 1, 2026. The EU AI Act enforcement escalates through 2026. Your AI models in lending, underwriting, and fraud detection need documented governance — or you're exposed.

**The real cost of non-compliance:**
- $50K–$500K per violation (state AG enforcement)
- Consent orders that freeze AI deployments
- Board-level liability for undocumented algorithmic decisions

## What We Do

AfrexAI deploys AI governance frameworks in **3 weeks, not 3 quarters.** We've done it for healthcare systems under HHS deadlines — financial services is the same playbook, different regulator.

### Week 1: Audit & Risk Map
- Inventory every AI/ML model touching consumer decisions
- Map each to regulatory requirements (SB 24-205, ECOA, CFPB 1033)
- Classify risk tiers and document decision logic

### Week 2: Framework Build
- Bias testing protocols with statistical validation
- Model documentation that satisfies AG inquiry
- Consumer disclosure templates and notification workflows

### Week 3: Operationalize
- Monitoring dashboards for ongoing drift detection
- Staff training and escalation procedures
- AG-ready documentation package
