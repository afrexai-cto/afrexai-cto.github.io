**Subject:** AI governance before April 3 — BioMarin's clock is ticking

Hi Arpit,

Congrats on the BioMarin role. Moving from Amgen's AI transformation to rare disease biotech — that's a fascinating shift.

Quick question: how's BioMarin tracking against the HHS AI governance mandate hitting April 3?

Most pharma/biotech CIOs I talk to are scrambling. The mandate covers bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security controls, and human oversight — across every division. It's broad and the deadline is tight.

We deploy managed AI agents that handle the heavy lifting: automated compliance monitoring, clinical documentation workflows, and governance reporting. One healthcare client went from "no AI strategy" to fully compliant in 3 weeks.

Given you're building your technology vision at BioMarin from scratch, this might save you months of internal buildout.

Worth 20 minutes this week?

**Notes:**
- Lead with HHS urgency (April 3 deadline — 6 weeks away)
- Reference his Amgen AI background to show research
- BioMarin's rare disease focus = smaller patient populations = AI governance is more scrutinized
- Don't mention "agents" buzzword in subject — lead with business problem
