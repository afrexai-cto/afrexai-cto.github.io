# Candescent AXIS 2026 — Speaking Proposal
*Created: 2026-02-21*
*Event: April 21-23, 2026 | Candescent AXIS Conference*

## Proposed Session Title
**"Beyond Chatbots: How Community Banks Are Building AI Operations That Pass Examiner Review"**

## Session Format
Breakout session (30-40 minutes) or panel participation

## Abstract

Every community bank vendor is pitching AI. Few are talking about what happens after deployment: governance, audit trails, fair lending compliance, and examiner readiness.

This session cuts through the AI hype with a practical framework for community banks evaluating or deploying AI agents. Attendees will learn:

1. **The AI Operations Gap** — Why buying AI tools isn't the same as running AI operations, and what examiners are starting to ask
2. **Governance-First Deployment** — A step-by-step approach to deploying AI agents with built-in compliance documentation, bias monitoring, and decision audit trails
3. **Real Numbers** — Cost benchmarks, timeline expectations, and ROI metrics from banks that have moved from chatbots to managed AI operations
4. **The Examiner Test** — What OCC and NCUA examiners look for when reviewing AI systems, and how to prepare documentation that satisfies regulatory review

Attendees will leave with a practical checklist for evaluating AI vendors and a governance framework they can implement immediately.
