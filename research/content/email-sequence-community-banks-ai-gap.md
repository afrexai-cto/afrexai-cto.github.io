## Email 1 — Day 0: "Your Core Provider Won't Save You on AI"

**Subject:** Your core provider scored 3.19/5 on innovation. Here's what that means for AI.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

The ABA's 2024 Core Platforms Survey just confirmed what most community bank leaders already feel: overall satisfaction at 3.19/5, with innovation capabilities scoring even lower.

Meanwhile, the OCC's latest RFI flagged that the three CSPs serving 70%+ of depository institutions aren't keeping pace with AI demands. Community banks are stuck with black-box AI they can't validate, creating real compliance exposure under fair lending laws.

Large banks are deploying machine learning across lending, operations, and customer engagement at scale. The gap is widening every quarter.

We help community banks implement AI agents that actually work — fraud detection, compliance automation, credit decisioning — without waiting 18 months for your core provider's roadmap.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense? I can show you what a $500M-$2B bank implemented in 6 weeks.

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Email 2 — Day 5: "The OCC Is Watching. Are You Ready?"

**Subject:** OCC's AI guidance is coming. 3 things to do before it lands.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my last note. The OCC's Request for Information on core service providers specifically called out AI governance gaps — opaque model logic, restricted data access, and compliance blind spots.

Regulatory guidance is coming. Banks that can demonstrate AI governance and validation frameworks NOW will be ahead of the curve. Banks relying on provider black boxes will be scrambling.

Three things we help banks implement before guidance drops:

1. **AI model governance framework** — document every AI decision point, from fraud flags to credit scoring
2. **Vendor AI validation protocol** — stop accepting black boxes from your CSP
3. **Compliance-ready AI agents** — transparent, auditable, deployed in weeks not years

We've done this for regulated financial institutions. Happy to share the playbook.

Worth 15 minutes?

## Email 3 — Day 12: "Your Competitors Aren't Waiting"

**Subject:** Interface.ai just raised for community bank AI. The window is closing.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Last note from me. Quick update: interface.ai just announced its expansion into agentic AI for community financial institutions (Feb 18). Vendor solutions are flooding the market.

The question isn't whether your bank will use AI agents. It's whether you'll control the implementation or have it dictated to you.

We're the implementation partner that sits between you and the vendor hype — building AI that actually works for YOUR operations, YOUR compliance requirements, YOUR data.

If this isn't a priority right now, no worries. But if you're evaluating AI partners, I'd rather you talk to us before signing a vendor contract.

## Targeting Notes
- **ICP:** Community banks $500M-$5B in assets, CEO or CIO/CTO
- **Pain points:** Core provider lock-in, AI governance gaps, OCC regulatory pressure, competitive disadvantage vs large banks
- **Differentiation:** We're not another vendor selling black-box AI. We implement transparent, auditable AI agents the bank controls.
- **Sources:** CCG Catalyst (Feb 16), ABA Core Platforms Survey 2024, OCC RFI, interface.ai announcement (Feb 18)
- **Volume:** Target 30-50 community banks initially, focus on those with >$1B assets and recent tech leadership hires
