# AfrexAI Healthcare: "AI That Ships"
*For Healthcare CIOs, CDIOs, and VP Innovation — February 2026*

---

## The Capital Market Just Told You What to Buy

Black Book Research surveyed 320 healthcare investors (VCs, PE, banks) at VIVE and JP Morgan Healthcare 2026. The verdict:

> **"Healthcare technology is still investable, but ONLY when it is deployable, integration-ready, and provably resilient."**

### What Investors Are Funding (and What Your Board Will Ask About)

| Priority | % of Investors | AfrexAI Delivers |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| AI documentation / clinician workflow automation | **58%** | ✅ Production-ready agents |
| Revenue cycle / denials / prior auth automation | **52%** | ✅ Claims processing agents |
| Unit economics clarity | **65%** | ✅ ROI measurement built-in |
| Clinical evidence / outcomes data | **55%** | ✅ Governance + audit trails |
| Governed AI with formal validation | **80%** | ✅ HHS-aligned AI governance |

### The Failure Stats They're Tracking

- **80%** say vendor AI claims are difficult to verify without formal governance
- **70%** report at least one failed AI pilot (weak endpoints, workflow misalignment, data gaps)
- **69%** had a vendor-traceable cyber incident or near miss in 24 months

### Why AfrexAI, Why Now

**We don't sell AI pilots. We deploy AI that ships.**

1. **Production-or-bust ready** — Our agents are deployed in live workflows, not sandboxes
2. **HHS April 3 compliance built-in** — AI governance, bias mitigation, human oversight from day one
3. **Measurable ROI** — Unit economics documented before deployment, tracked after
4. **Managed, not abandoned** — We run your AI workforce. You get outcomes, not another vendor to manage.

### The Clock Is Ticking

- **HHS AI governance mandate: April 3, 2026** — 6 weeks away
- **80% of investors** now require governed AI as baseline
- **70% of AI pilots fail** — yours doesn't have to
