# Colorado SB 24-205 Is Live — Here's What Fintech Lenders Need to Do Before June 30

*By AfrexAI | February 2026*

Colorado just became ground zero for AI regulation in financial services.

SB 24-205 — the Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence act — went into effect February 1, 2026. Attorney General enforcement kicks in **June 30, 2026**. That gives you about four months to get compliant or face penalties.

And if you're a fintech lender using AI for credit decisions, underwriting, or risk scoring? You're squarely in the crosshairs.

## What SB 24-205 Actually Requires

Cut through the legal noise. Here's what matters:

**If you deploy a "high-risk AI system"** (and yes, lending decisions qualify):

1. **Risk management policy** — Document how you identify, mitigate, and monitor algorithmic discrimination risks. Not a checkbox. An actual working policy.

2. **Impact assessments** — Before deploying AND after every model retrain. Most teams miss the retrain trigger. Every time you update your model, you need a new assessment.

3. **Transparency to consumers** — Tell people when AI is making decisions about them. Provide a way to appeal. Not buried in ToS footnote — actual, accessible disclosure.

4. **Reasonable care standard** — The law says "reasonable care to protect consumers from known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination." Vague? Yes. That's the point. The AG gets to decide what "reasonable" means.

5. **90-day disclosure window** — The Attorney General can demand your compliance documentation. You have 90 days to produce it. If it doesn't exist, that's your answer — and your problem.

## Why Most Fintech Teams Aren't Ready

We've talked to compliance leaders at a dozen lending companies. The pattern is consistent:

- **They don't know what counts as "high-risk."** If your AI touches credit, insurance, employment, housing, or healthcare — it's high-risk. Full stop.
- **They've never done an algorithmic impact assessment.** Most have bias testing. That's not the same thing.
- **Model retrains happen weekly.** Each one technically triggers a new assessment. Nobody's doing that.
- **Their documentation is scattered.** Model cards in one place, bias reports in another, no unified governance framework.

## The Four-Month Playbook

Here's what a compliant fintech looks like by June 30:

### Month 1: Inventory & Gap Analysis
- Map every AI system touching consumer decisions
- Classify each as high-risk or not (err on the side of high-risk)
- Identify your current documentation gaps

### Month 2: Policy & Framework
- Draft your risk management policy (the law is specific about what it must include)
- Build your impact assessment template
- Create your consumer disclosure language

### Month 3: Implementation
- Run impact assessments on all high-risk systems
- Set up automated triggers for reassessment on model retrains
- Train your team on the new workflows

### Month 4: Testing & Remediation
- Simulate an AG disclosure request — can you produce everything in 90 days?
- Fix gaps. Document everything.
- Establish ongoing monitoring cadence

## The Hidden Cost of Waiting

Traditional compliance consulting firms will charge you $500K-$1M for this. And they'll take 9-12 months.

You have four.

AI-powered compliance automation can cut that to 3 weeks and $120K. That's not a pitch — that's math. The same AI tools that trigger these requirements can automate the compliance process itself.

## What Happens If You Ignore It

The AG hasn't announced specific penalty schedules yet. But Colorado's consumer protection penalties historically run $20,000 per violation. Per consumer. Do that math with your loan volume.

More importantly: this is the first domino. Illinois, Connecticut, and Texas have similar bills moving. Whatever you build for Colorado becomes your template for the next five states.
