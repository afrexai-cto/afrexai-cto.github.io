# Sean Ford Call Prep Sheet — 15:00 GMT Today
## Skilled Real Estate, Miami

### Opening (2 min)
"Sean, thanks for taking the time. I know you filled out our AI automation wizard — I want to make sure we give you something real, not just a demo."

### Discovery Questions (10 min)
1. What's your team size? How many agents/brokers?
2. Walk me through a typical deal from lead to close — where does it get slow?
3. How much time does your team spend on paperwork vs. selling?
4. Are you using any automation today? CRM? Transaction management?
5. What would it mean if you could free up 15-20 hours per week across the team?

### Pain Points to Probe (Real Estate Specific)
- **Lead response time** — 78% of buyers go with the first agent who responds. Are leads sitting?
- **Transaction coordination** — avg 180+ tasks per deal. How many fall through cracks?
- **Compliance docs** — state-specific forms, disclosures. Manual or automated?
- **Follow-up** — past clients, nurture sequences. Consistent or sporadic?

### Our Solution (5 min)
"Here's what we'd deploy for you in Week 1:"
- **Lead Response Agent** — responds to new inquiries in <2 minutes, 24/7
- **Transaction Coordinator Agent** — tracks every task, deadline, document
- **Client Nurture Agent** — automated follow-ups, market updates, anniversary touches
- **Compliance Monitor** — ensures docs are complete before closing

### Pricing (3 min)
- **Intro offer: $750 first month** (normally $3,500/mo for single agent)
- **Full swarm: $5,500/mo** after month 1
- **ROI math**: If agents close even 1 extra deal/month from faster lead response = $8K-15K commission. The service pays for itself 2-3x over.

### Objection Handling
- "Too expensive" → "What's one lost deal worth? One missed lead that went to a competitor?"
- "We already have a CRM" → "CRM stores data. Our agents ACT on it. Different category entirely."
- "Need to think about it" → "Totally fair. How about this — we deploy the lead response agent for 7 days, you see the results, then decide. Zero risk."
- "What if it doesn't work?" → "Week 1 is $750. If you don't see clear value, you walk. No contract."

### Close
"Sean, I can have your first agent running by Friday. Want to lock in the $750 intro rate?"

### Post-Call
- Send follow-up email within 30 min (pre-written: `sean-ford-post-call-followup.md`)
- If yes → trigger onboarding checklist (`aaas-onboarding-checklist.md`)
- If maybe → schedule follow-up for Wednesday
- If no → log reason, move to nurture
