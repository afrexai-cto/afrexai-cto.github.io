# AI Agents for Insurance: From Pilot to Production in 90 Days

## The Problem
Insurance carriers spend **$15-25B annually** on manual claims processing, underwriting review, and compliance reporting. 73% of AI pilots in insurance never reach production. The gap isn't technology — it's implementation.

## What AfrexAI Does
We deploy **managed AI agent workforces** that handle real insurance operations:

### Claims Processing Agents
- **First Notice of Loss (FNOL) triage** — auto-classify, route, and prioritize incoming claims
- **Document extraction** — pull key data from police reports, medical records, repair estimates
- **Fraud pattern detection** — flag anomalies across claim history, provider networks, and timing
- **Result:** 60-70% reduction in processing time, 40% fewer touches per claim

### Underwriting Agents
- **Submission intake** — parse broker submissions, extract risk factors, pre-populate systems
- **Risk scoring** — cross-reference external data (weather, crime, financials) in seconds
- **Appetite matching** — auto-decline out-of-appetite risks before they waste underwriter time
- **Result:** 3x faster quote turnaround, 25% improvement in loss ratios

### Compliance & Regulatory Agents
- **State filing monitoring** — track regulatory changes across all 50 states + DC
- **Colorado SB 205 compliance** — automated bias testing, documentation, and audit trails
- **Market conduct exam prep** — pre-audit document assembly and gap analysis
- **Result:** 80% reduction in compliance labor, always audit-ready
