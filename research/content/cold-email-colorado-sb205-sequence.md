## Email 1: The Deadline (Day 0)

**Subject:** Colorado AI Act — your compliance clock is ticking

Hi {{first_name}},

Colorado SB 24-205 is now law. If {{company}} uses AI in lending, underwriting, or credit decisions — you're in scope.

The AG can request your impact assessments and risk documentation with 90 days notice. Enforcement starts June 30. That's 4.5 months to get compliant.

Most teams I talk to are stuck on three things:
1. What counts as a "high-risk AI system" in their stack
2. How to run algorithmic discrimination testing at scale
3. Building the documentation trail the AG expects

We help fintechs automate AI compliance — impact assessments, bias monitoring, consumer disclosure — using managed AI agents that run continuously, not just at audit time.

Worth a 15-minute call to see where {{company}} stands?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: The Risk (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Colorado AI Act — your compliance clock is ticking

{{first_name}}, quick follow-up.

The tricky part of SB-205 isn't the requirements — it's proving "reasonable care." The AG doesn't define it. You have to demonstrate it.

That means continuous monitoring, documented processes, and audit-ready impact assessments. Not a one-time checkbox.

We built AI agents specifically for this: they monitor your models for drift and discrimination, generate impact assessments automatically, and maintain the documentation trail.

One fintech we worked with went from zero compliance infrastructure to audit-ready in 6 weeks.

If you're evaluating how to handle this, I'd love to share what's working.

## Email 3: The Cost of Inaction (Day 9)

**Subject:** Quick math on SB-205 non-compliance

{{first_name}},

The penalty for SB-205 violations runs through the Colorado Consumer Protection Act — $20K per violation, no cap. For an AI system making thousands of decisions daily, that adds up fast.

But the real cost is reputational. First company to get an AG enforcement action becomes the cautionary tale at every compliance conference.

We help companies like {{company}} get ahead of this with automated compliance agents — continuous bias monitoring, auto-generated impact assessments, consumer disclosure automation.

Happy to send a quick overview of what the compliance stack looks like. No call needed if you prefer async.
