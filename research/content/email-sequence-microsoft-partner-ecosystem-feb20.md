# Email Sequence: Microsoft Partner Ecosystem Opportunity
## Target: IT Consulting Firms / MSPs Looking to Add AI Services
## Angle: "White-label AfrexAI's managed AI workforce for your clients"

### Why This Matters
Microsoft's Feb 2026 partner update is pushing ALL partners toward AI. Most MSPs and IT consultants have zero AI implementation capability. They need a partner who can deliver. That's us.

### Target Profile
- Microsoft Solution Partners (500+ in US alone)
- MSPs serving mid-market ($50M-$500M revenue clients)
- IT consulting firms with 10-100 employees
- Already selling Microsoft 365, Azure, Dynamics

### Email 1 — Day 0: "Your clients are asking about AI. Can you deliver?"

**Subject:** Your clients want AI agents. Do you have an answer?

Hi [Name],

Microsoft just expanded its AI partner benefits — Copilot Studio, Dragon Copilot, the works. Your clients are going to start asking harder questions about AI implementation.

Here's the problem: Copilot handles the easy stuff. But when a client wants AI agents that actually automate workflows — compliance screening, contract review, claims processing — most partners can't deliver.

That's where we come in.

AfrexAI builds managed AI workforces for financial services, legal, and healthcare. We're looking for channel partners who already have client relationships in these verticals.

The model is simple: you bring the relationship, we bring the AI implementation. Revenue share on every engagement.

Worth 15 minutes to explore?

### Email 2 — Day 5: "How one partner added $200K in AI revenue"

**Subject:** How MSPs are adding $200K+ in AI services revenue

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about AI implementation partnerships.

Here's what we're seeing: IT consulting firms that add managed AI services are booking $140K-$360K per client engagement. That's on top of existing Microsoft licensing revenue.

The sweet spot is mid-market clients ($50M-$500M) in regulated industries who:
- Need AI but can't hire AI engineers
- Face compliance deadlines (Basel III.1, HHS April 3, SEC AI disclosure)
- Want outcomes, not science projects

We handle the technical implementation. You handle the client relationship and ongoing account management. Clean split.

If this sounds interesting, I'd love to walk you through how it works.

### Email 3 — Day 12: "Last note — partner slots filling"

**Subject:** Quick follow-up — partner program

Hi [Name],

Last note on this — we're onboarding channel partners in Q1 and want to keep numbers manageable so we can deliver quality.

If adding AI implementation services to your portfolio is on your radar for 2026, let's connect this week.

If not, no worries at all — I'll take the hint.
