$1 trillion.

That's how much U.S. healthcare wastes on admin every year. Claims processing. Prior authorizations. Coding. Credentialing.

Daffodil Health just raised $16.3M to go after this with AI. They're focused on claims and pricing logic for health plans.

But here's what I keep seeing:

Health systems don't lack AI tools. They lack implementation.

They've got 3 pilots running, 2 vendors in evaluation, and a new HHS mandate (April 3) requiring documented AI governance across every division.

The gap isn't technology. It's getting AI to actually work inside regulated workflows — with audit trails, bias monitoring, and human oversight built in.

That's exactly what we do at AfrexAI.

If your team is staring down the April 3 deadline and wondering how to deploy AI that's both useful AND compliant — let's talk.
