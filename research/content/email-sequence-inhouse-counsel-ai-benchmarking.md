*3-touch sequence targeting GCs and Deputy GCs at mid-market companies ($500M-$5B revenue)*
*Angle: Help in-house teams USE AI to benchmark outside counsel, then sell implementation*

## Email 1: The Opening (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your outside counsel's AI problem is your opportunity

Hi {{first_name}},

Thomson Reuters published their 2026 AI in Professional Services report last week. One number jumped out:

Only 18% of law firms measure AI ROI. But 40% say they've adopted it org-wide.

Translation: your firms are using AI on your matters. They're probably not telling you about it. And they definitely aren't passing the savings along.

We built an AI agent workflow that helps in-house teams do two things:

1. Automate the repeatable legal work you're currently outsourcing (contract review, NDA processing, compliance screening)
2. Benchmark what that work *should* cost — so you can renegotiate with data, not gut feel

One of our clients saved $111K on a single implementation before we even finished building. Not theoretical — actual dollars not spent on outside counsel.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough be worth your time this week?

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Your outside counsel's AI problem is your opportunity

{{first_name}} — quick follow-up with a specific example.

Baker McKenzie just cut 600-1,000 support staff, explicitly citing AI (Feb 11). That's 10% of their global workforce.

Here's what that means for you: the work those staff did — document processing, first-pass reviews, compliance checks — is now being done by AI. The firms aren't reducing your bills accordingly.

Above the Law ran a piece this week calling it "the transparency crisis." In-house teams that benchmark AI costs now are positioning themselves to renegotiate every outside counsel arrangement.

We've helped teams set this up in under a week. Real agents doing real work, not a demo that never goes live.

Happy to show you what this looks like for {{company_name}}'s legal ops.

Christina

## Email 3: The Breakup (Day 10)

**Subject:** last note on legal AI benchmarking

{{first_name}},

I'll keep this short — I know you're busy.

If benchmarking outside counsel with AI isn't a priority right now, totally get it. But if it is, we're currently offering a free "Week 1 Win" assessment:

→ We map your top 5 repeatable legal workflows
→ Deploy an AI agent on the simplest one
→ You see real output in 5 business days

No contract. No platform license. Just a working agent doing actual work.

If timing's better in Q2, I'll circle back then. Either way, happy to be a resource.
