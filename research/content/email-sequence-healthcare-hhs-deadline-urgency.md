## Email 1 — Day 0: "6 Weeks Until April 3"
**Subject:** Your AI governance deadline is 6 weeks away
**To:** New CIO/CDIO at target health system

Hi [First Name],

Congrats on the [title] role at [Organization]. Big move — and big timing.

You've probably already heard about the HHS AI governance mandate hitting April 3. Every division needs documented AI governance practices — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security protocols, human oversight frameworks.

6 weeks. For most health systems, that's not enough time to build from scratch.

We've been helping mid-market health systems stand up AI governance frameworks in 3-4 weeks. Not theoretical — actual working governance with the monitoring and documentation HHS expects.

If you're staring at that April deadline and thinking "how do we get there," I'd love to share what's working.

Worth a 15-minute call next week?

## Email 2 — Day 5: "What HHS Actually Expects"
**Subject:** Re: What HHS actually requires (and what most orgs miss)

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up — I've been talking to several health system CIOs about the April 3 deadline, and there's a pattern in what organizations miss:

1. **Bias mitigation isn't optional** — HHS wants documented testing, not just a policy statement
2. **Outcome monitoring needs to be continuous** — point-in-time audits won't cut it
3. **Human oversight must be operational** — not just "a human reviews it sometimes"

Most orgs have 1 of 3. HHS wants all 3, working together, with evidence.

We've built a compliance readiness assessment that scores where you stand across all HHS requirements. Takes 5 minutes. Tells you exactly what gaps to close before April 3.

Want me to send the link?

## Email 3 — Day 10: "HIMSS Attendees Are Already Asking"
**Subject:** Quick question before HIMSS

Hi [First Name],

Last one from me — I know your inbox is probably HIMSS prep right now.

Quick question: are you attending any of the AI governance sessions at HIMSS26? Jeremy Harper from Owl Health Works is doing a great workshop on deploying LLMs affordably for clinical workflows.

We're also putting together a small roundtable of health system CIOs who are navigating the HHS deadline in real-time. Informal, no pitch, just comparing notes on what governance frameworks actually pass muster.

If you're interested in joining (virtual or at HIMSS), just reply "interested" and I'll send details.

Either way — good luck with the new role. The industry needs strong digital leadership right now.

## Key Hooks
- **April 3 deadline** — concrete, ticking clock, regulatory consequence
- **New in role** — need quick wins, don't have existing frameworks
- **HIMSS26** — industry gathering creates urgency and FOMO
- **"First ever" roles** (Gardenhire at Michigan Medicine) — greenfield, needs everything built

## Sending Notes
- Send from: ksmolichki@afrexai.com as Christina Beckford
- ⚠️ Needs Christina approval before sending
- Personalize [Organization] and [title] for each target
- Michigan Medicine is highest priority — first-ever CDIO = maximum need
