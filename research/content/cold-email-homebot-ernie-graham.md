## Email 1: Opening (Subject: Homebot + SB-205 — quick question)

Ernie,

Homebot's AI recommendations touch lending decisions for thousands of homeowners. Under Colorado SB-205 (enforcement starts June 30), that likely puts you in the "high-risk" deployer category.

Quick reality check: the law requires algorithmic impact assessments, consumer notification when AI influences financial decisions, and documented governance frameworks. Penalties start at $20K per violation with no aggregate cap.

We helped a $111K pre-delivery deal close for a financial services firm by building their AI governance framework in under 3 weeks. No fluff — just the documentation, monitoring, and audit trail regulators actually want to see.

Worth 15 minutes to see if there's a gap before June?

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Email 2: Follow-up (Day 4) — Subject: Re: Homebot + SB-205

Ernie,

One thing I didn't mention — SB-205 specifically calls out AI systems that influence "consequential decisions" in lending and housing. Homebot's core product (personalized home equity and refinance recommendations sent to borrowers) fits that definition precisely.

The tricky part: your lender clients may also have compliance obligations as "deployers" of your AI. If Homebot can offer them a compliance package alongside the product, that's a retention play and a revenue line.

Happy to walk through the specific SB-205 sections that apply. 15 min, no pitch.

## Email 3: Break-up (Day 9) — Subject: Last note on SB-205

Ernie,

Totally understand if timing's off. Leaving you with this: Colorado AG's enforcement guidance specifically mentions AI in consumer lending as a priority area. June 30 is 4 months away.

If this becomes urgent later, my calendar's open: [booking link]
