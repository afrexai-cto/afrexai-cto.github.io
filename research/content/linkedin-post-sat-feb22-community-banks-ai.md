"Can we build agents to understand that?"

That's the question one community bank COO asks before every process review.

Not "can we buy a chatbot." Not "can we get an AI vendor." Can we build agents.

Meanwhile, the CSI 2026 Banking Priorities Survey just dropped: 27% of community bank leaders now rank AI as their #1 strategic concern — surpassing cybersecurity for the first time.

But here's the gap nobody talks about:

97% of banks over $5B say they "understand AI." Yet most community banks are still in the data warehouse phase. Building the lake. Planning the strategy.

Understanding ≠ deploying.

The banks that close this gap in 2026 will own the next decade. The ones that wait for their core service provider to figure it out? They'll be playing catch-up until 2030.

Three things separating banks that deploy from banks that plan:

1. They start with one high-impact workflow (not a company-wide "AI strategy")
2. They build governance BEFORE they build agents
3. They measure in hours saved per week, not "AI maturity scores"

Your CSP won't tell you this. They're selling you their roadmap, not yours.
