## Email Body

**Subject: This week in AI regulation: Treasury, HHS, and Singapore moved. Did you?**

Hi [First Name],

Quick Friday roundup — three things that happened this week that affect how your firm will need to handle AI:

**1. U.S. Treasury released the first federal AI Risk Management Framework for financial services (Feb 18)**
Not guidance. A framework. With specific expectations around model governance, bias testing, and explainability. If you're in financial services, your compliance team needs to read this before Q2 planning.

**2. HHS April 3 deadline is now 6 weeks away**
All HHS divisions must adopt AI governance practices — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security protocols, human oversight. Healthcare orgs that haven't started are already behind.

**3. Singapore named legal as one of the first professions requiring AI transition support**
400% tax deductions for AI tools. Free premium subscriptions. Government-funded AI Champions programme. This isn't a US-only trend — it's global.

**The pattern:** Regulators aren't asking IF you'll implement AI governance. They're setting deadlines for WHEN.

The firms that build governance into their AI implementation from day one won't have to retrofit later. That's exactly what we help with.

Want a 15-minute walkthrough of what these changes mean for [industry]? I'll show you what the top firms in your space are doing.

Christina Beckford
