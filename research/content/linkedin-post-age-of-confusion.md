# LinkedIn Post: "The Age of AI Confusion"

McKinsey has launched tens of thousands of internal AI agents.

PwC, EY, BCG — all racing to do the same.

And yet, according to Business Insider this week, the consulting industry is now in what one former McKinsey partner calls "the age of confusion."

Why? Because nobody measured whether any of it actually works.

They tracked adoption. Logins. Usage rates. Vanity metrics.

What they didn't track: revenue impact, labor reallocation, actual ROI.

Sound familiar?

This is happening inside Fortune 500s right now. Thousands of AI pilots. Zero success metrics. Leadership asking "what did we get for all that spend?"

Here's what we've learned deploying AI agents for regulated industries:

→ If you can't measure the outcome in dollars or hours saved, don't deploy it
→ Week 1 should produce a working agent, not a strategy deck
→ Governance without deployment is just expensive paperwork

The firms that win won't be the ones with the most AI agents.

They'll be the ones who can prove what those agents actually did.

We deploy AI agents that work in Week 1 — with built-in measurement from day one.

If your AI strategy is stuck in "pilot purgatory," let's talk.
