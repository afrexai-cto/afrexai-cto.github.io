# Insurance Vertical — 3-Touch Email Sequence

**Target persona:** CIO/CTO/Chief Risk Officer at mid-to-large P&C carriers  
**Goal:** Book 20-min governance framework walkthrough  
**Spacing:** Day 1 → Day 4 → Day 9

## Email 1 — The Wake-Up (Day 1)

**Subject:** Your AI agents are making decisions. Who's auditing them?

{FirstName},

Most carriers I talk to have AI in claims, underwriting, or fraud detection. Some have all three. Almost none have a governance layer that maps agent decisions back to regulatory requirements.

That's a problem — because Colorado's SB 21-169 already requires algorithmic fairness audits, and the NAIC model bulletin is pushing every state toward similar rules.

We built a compliance framework specifically for P&C carriers deploying autonomous agents. It catches the gaps between what your AI does and what regulators expect — before the audit letter shows up.

Worth 20 minutes to see how it maps to {Company}'s regulatory exposure?

## Email 2 — The Proof Point (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Your AI agents are making decisions. Who's auditing them?

{FirstName},

Quick follow-up. One thing I didn't mention — the carriers who've looked at our framework keep finding the same blind spot: AI exclusions in their own D&O policies.

Think about it: your carrier is deploying AI internally while simultaneously excluding AI-related liability from the policies you sell. If a regulator flags algorithmic bias in your claims processing, your D&O policy might not cover the resulting action.

That's the kind of gap our governance mapping catches. Takes 20 minutes to walk through.

If the timing's off, no worries — but this gap isn't getting smaller.

## Email 3 — The Breakup (Day 9)

**Subject:** closing the loop

{FirstName},

Last note on this. I'll assume the timing isn't right and move on.

If AI governance lands on your priority list later this year — especially with NAIC pushing states toward mandatory algorithmic audits — here's where to find us: afrexai.com

One thing worth bookmarking: we published a free AI governance checklist for P&C carriers. No gate, no sales pitch. Might be useful when the topic comes up internally.

All the best,

## Sequence Notes
- **Personalize Email 1** with specific AI deployments if known (claims AI, underwriting models, etc.)
- **Email 2** D&O angle is contrarian and creates urgency — test this vs. a pure regulatory angle
- **Email 3** offers value even if no reply — builds goodwill for future outreach
- **Track opens/replies** — if Email 1 opens but no reply, prioritize Email 2 send
- **Do NOT send without Kalin's approval** — draft only per sales rules
