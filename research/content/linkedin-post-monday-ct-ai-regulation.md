Connecticut just dropped SB-2 — the most comprehensive state AI regulation we've seen yet.

Here's what insurance carriers need to know:

→ Developers AND deployers have obligations
→ 60-day right to cure expires June 30, 2026
→ CT Insurance Dept already issued Bulletin MC-25 requiring AI transparency
→ The AG can enforce. This isn't advisory.

If you're a carrier writing business in CT (and who isn't), the compliance clock is ticking.

Colorado SB 205 was the warning shot.
CT SB-2 is the real thing.

The carriers who build AI governance frameworks NOW will have a competitive advantage when every state follows Connecticut's lead.

We've helped insurers go from "we should probably look at this" to fully compliant AI operations in 3 weeks.
