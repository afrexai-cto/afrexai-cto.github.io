# Palantir Ecosystem Partnership — AfrexAI Opportunity Brief
*Created: 2026-02-20 21:56 GMT*

## The Opportunity

ISG announced today (Feb 20) they're launching a **Palantir Ecosystem Partners** assessment — results published July 2026 in their Provider Lens® report. This means:

1. **Palantir is formalizing its partner ecosystem** — moving from ad-hoc to structured channel
2. **ISG is tracking who implements Palantir well** — getting on this report = enterprise credibility
3. **Enterprise buyers will use this report to choose implementation partners**

## Why This Matters for AfrexAI

Palantir AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) is deployed across:
- **Financial services** (our #1 vertical) — JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley use Palantir
- **Healthcare** (our #3 vertical) — NHS, Cleveland Clinic, HCA Healthcare
- **Legal/compliance** — regulatory intelligence and document analysis
- **Government → Commercial crossover** — Palantir's biggest growth vector

Palantir's model: sell the platform, let partners implement. They NEED consulting firms to scale.

## AfrexAI Fit

| Palantir Need | AfrexAI Capability |
|---|---|
| Vertical-specific AI implementation | Our entire model — finserv, healthcare, legal |
| Managed AI operations (post-deployment) | "Your AI Workforce, Managed" — exactly this |
| Governance & compliance built-in | HHS, Basel III.1, SEC — we already lead with this |
| Mid-market reach (Palantir historically enterprise-only) | Our sweet spot: $500M-$5B revenue companies |

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Get on ISG's Radar (March 2026)
- Submit to ISG Provider Lens® questionnaire when it opens
- Position: "Palantir AIP implementation + managed AI operations for regulated industries"
- Differentiation: vertical expertise + ongoing management (not project-based)

### Phase 2: Palantir Partner Application
- Apply to Palantir's partner program
- Lead with: finserv compliance automation on AIP, healthcare governance on AIP
- Bring a POC: offer to co-implement with a prospect using AIP as backbone

### Phase 3: Content & Credibility
- Publish "Palantir AIP for Regulated Industries" guide
- Case study format: how AfrexAI would deploy AIP for community bank compliance
- LinkedIn content series positioning AfrexAI as Palantir-fluent

## Key Contact Points
- **Palantir Partner Program**: partners@palantir.com / partner portal
- **ISG Provider Lens®**: Submit via isg-one.com when questionnaire opens
- **Palantir AIP Boot Camps**: Free training events — get team certified

## Risk
- Palantir is expensive ($1M+ platform) — may not fit our mid-market targets
- Counter: Palantir is actively pushing downmarket with AIP for Startups and foundry pricing tiers
- We'd position as the implementation layer that makes Palantir affordable for mid-market

## Bottom Line
Palantir partnership = instant credibility + enterprise deal flow + ISG report listing. This is a 6-month play that could unlock $2-5M in pipeline by end of 2026.
