Greg,

Read your Texas Lawbook piece on the Claude Crash. You raised something most people in legal tech are dancing around — that agentic AI isn't a future problem, it's a right-now problem.

That's exactly what we build for. AfrexAI deploys managed AI agent workforces for law firms. Not the chatbot-in-a-sidebar stuff. Autonomous agents that handle contract review queues, regulatory monitoring, and due diligence triage without human babysitting.

One stat that might interest you: 97% of general counsel increased their workload last year, but only 39% are using AI at all (FTI/Relativity GC Report, Feb 2026). The firms that close that gap first win structurally.

Would be worth a 15-minute call to compare notes on what's actually working in agentic deployment vs. what's just marketing. Happy to share what we're seeing across Am Law firms.

**Notes:**
- Opens with his specific article — shows genuine engagement
- GC Report stat creates urgency without being pushy
- Positions as peer conversation, not a sales pitch
- "Right-now problem" mirrors his own framing
