## Body

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

April 3 is 43 days out. That's when HHS requires every division to have AI governance practices in place — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security controls, human oversight.

Most health systems I've talked to are still figuring out where to start.

We helped a $111K enterprise client go from zero AI governance to fully compliant in under 90 days. The framework covers the exact requirements HHS laid out: automated bias detection, audit trails, role-based access, and human-in-the-loop controls.

Would a 20-minute call next week make sense? I can walk through what the mandate actually requires and where most orgs get stuck.

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Follow-up (Day 7)
Subject: Re: April 3 is 43 days away

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Quick follow-up. The April 3 HHS deadline is now 36 days out.

I put together a one-page breakdown of the 5 governance controls HHS requires. Happy to send it over — no call needed.

Worth a look?

Christina
