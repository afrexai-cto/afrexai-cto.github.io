## Email Body:

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Saw that [COMPANY] has been [SPECIFIC_DETAIL — growing, recent acquisition, new regulation exposure, etc.]. That usually means your legal team is stretched thin and your outside counsel invoices are climbing.

Here's what we're seeing with similar companies: in-house teams are deploying AI agents to handle contract review, compliance monitoring, and regulatory tracking internally. Not replacing lawyers — replacing the routine work that shouldn't need a $600/hour associate.

The result? 40-60% reduction in outside counsel spend. And faster turnaround, because the agent doesn't bill by the hour.

We built this for a $111K engagement last year — delivered in weeks, not months.

Would it make sense to show you a 15-minute demo of what this looks like for a [INDUSTRY] legal team?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
