## Body

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Quick question — did you catch that every US federal agency is now required to have a Chief AI Officer?

Not optional. Mandated.

When the government moves this fast on something, the private sector usually follows within 18 months. In [INDUSTRY], the firms moving now are locking in the talent and the workflows before the rush.

We help [INDUSTRY] companies deploy AI agents that handle [SPECIFIC_WORKFLOW] — not chatbots, but actual autonomous workflows that run end-to-end.

One example: a [SIMILAR_COMPANY] cut [METRIC] by [X]% in the first 90 days.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?
