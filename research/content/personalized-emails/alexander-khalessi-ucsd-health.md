## Email 1 — Week of Feb 24 (Cold Intro)
**Subject:** AI governance before April 3 — UCSD Health

Hi Dr. Khalessi,

Congratulations on the CIO + AVC appointment — leading AI integration across both the health system and academic enterprise is a rare dual mandate.

I noticed Chancellor Khosla's comments about pushing AI boundaries while enhancing patient well-being. That's exactly the tension we help health systems navigate.

We build managed AI agent workforces for healthcare organizations — not chatbots, but actual working systems that handle clinical documentation, claims processing, and compliance workflows. The HHS AI governance mandate hitting April 3 is creating urgency for a lot of systems right now.

Given you're standing up AI strategy across UCSD Health from scratch, would a 15-minute call be useful? Happy to share what's working at other academic medical centers.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — 5 days after Email 1 (Value Add)
**Subject:** How one AMC cut documentation time 40%

Dr. Khalessi,

Quick follow-up — thought this might be useful as you build out AI strategy at UCSD Health.

We recently mapped the most common AI deployment patterns across academic medical centers. The three highest-ROI starting points:

1. **Clinical documentation automation** — 30-40% time savings for physicians (biggest win for clinician satisfaction)
2. **Claims processing agents** — reducing denials by 15-25% with AI-driven pre-submission review
3. **HHS AI governance compliance** — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, human oversight frameworks (deadline: April 3)

The Jacobs Center for Health Innovation seems like a natural home for piloting these. We can have a working demo running within 7 days of kickoff.

Worth a quick conversation?

## Email 3 — 7 days after Email 2 (Last Touch)
**Subject:** One question, Dr. Khalessi

Hi Dr. Khalessi,

Last note — I know your inbox is probably intense right now.

One question: has UCSD Health already selected an AI implementation partner, or is that decision still ahead of you?

If it's still open, I'd love 15 minutes to show you how we work. If you've already chosen a direction, no worries at all — happy to be a resource either way.

Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
