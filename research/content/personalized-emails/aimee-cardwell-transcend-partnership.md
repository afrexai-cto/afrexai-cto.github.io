# Partnership Pitch: Aimee Cardwell — CIO & CISO in Residence, Transcend
*Drafted: 2026-02-18 | Send: Christina via LinkedIn or email, week of Feb 24*

## Context
- **Role:** CIO and CISO in Residence at Transcend (expanded from CISO-only, Feb 12 2026)
- **Background:** Former CIO + CISO at UnitedHealth Group, VP Product Dev at American Express
- **Transcend:** Data privacy infrastructure — helps enterprises manage customer data permissions
- **Why partnership:** Transcend solves data governance/permissions; AfrexAI solves AI agent implementation. Together = "deploy AI responsibly with clean data AND managed agents." Complementary, not competitive.
- **Her thesis:** Enterprises can't responsibly activate AI when customer data and permissions are fragmented. She's helping CIOs unlock AI at scale.

## Angle: Technology Partnership (Not a Sale)
Transcend's clients need Transcend for data governance PLUS someone to actually build and manage the AI agents that use that governed data. AfrexAI fills the implementation gap.

## Email 1: Partnership Introduction (Day 1)

**Subject:** Transcend + AI agents — complementary gap we keep seeing

Hi Aimee,

Congrats on the expanded CIO & CISO in Residence role — the timing makes perfect sense given what we're hearing from enterprise buyers.

I'm Christina Beckford, CEO of AfrexAI. We build and manage AI agent workforces for mid-market enterprises, primarily in financial services, healthcare, and legal.

We keep running into the same pattern you described in the Transcend announcement: CIOs want to deploy AI agents but stall because their data permissions are a mess. By the time they sort that out, the AI budget window closes.

We've been thinking about a joint approach: Transcend handles data governance and consent infrastructure, AfrexAI handles the AI agent layer on top. Client gets responsible AI deployment without the 12-month science project.

Would a 20-minute call make sense to explore whether there's something here? No pitch — just comparing notes on what enterprise buyers actually need.

Best,
Christina

## Email 2: Value Add (Day 5, if no reply)

**Subject:** re: Transcend + AI agents

Hi Aimee,

Quick follow-up — wanted to share something concrete.

We recently mapped the AI implementation timeline for a healthcare system (HHS April 3 deadline was the forcing function). The #1 blocker wasn't model selection or compute — it was data access governance. Exactly what Transcend solves.

If Transcend clients could go from "data is governed" to "AI agents are live" in weeks instead of months, that's a compelling joint value prop.

Happy to share our healthcare implementation playbook if useful for your advisory work, no strings attached.

## Email 3: Soft Close (Day 12, if no reply)

**Subject:** re: Transcend + AI agents

Hi Aimee,

Last note on this — I know the "partnership" inbox is noisy.

The short version: we think there's a natural handoff between what Transcend does (data governance) and what we do (AI agent deployment). A few of our prospects have independently mentioned needing both.

If the timing isn't right now, totally understand. But if a conversation makes sense down the road, I'm easy to find.

Christina
