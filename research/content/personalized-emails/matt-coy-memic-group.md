### Email 1 — "The first 90 days" (Day 1)

**Subject:** Welcome back to MEMIC, Matt — quick thought on your AI roadmap

Matt,

Congrats on the CIO role. Coming back to MEMIC with fresh eyes and a PMP mindset — that's a strong combination for what's ahead.

Most new CIOs in insurance tell us the same thing: there's a stack of AI vendor pitches on the desk before day one. The hard part isn't finding AI tools — it's knowing which ones actually move the needle for workers' comp specifically.

We work with insurance carriers to deploy AI agents that handle claims triage, fraud pattern detection, and policyholder communication — not generic chatbots, but purpose-built workflows that understand WC-specific data.

Would a 15-minute call be useful? Happy to share what's working at carriers your size without any pitch attached.

Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

### Email 2 — "The WC-specific angle" (Day 4)

**Subject:** Claims processing bottleneck most WC carriers miss

Matt,

One pattern we see at workers' comp carriers: claims adjusters spend 40-60% of their time on documentation and status updates rather than actual claim evaluation.

AI agents can handle that entire documentation layer — intake processing, medical record summarization, reserve recommendations — while adjusters focus on the decisions that actually require human judgment.

For a super-regional carrier like MEMIC, that typically translates to 30-40% faster cycle times and significantly lower LAE ratios.

Worth a conversation?

### Email 3 — "Social proof + urgency" (Day 8)

**Subject:** Quick question, Matt

Matt,

Just circling back. I know the first few months in a new CIO seat are a firehose.

If AI strategy isn't the priority right now, totally get it. But if you're evaluating options for Q2-Q3, we put together a short implementation timeline for WC carriers that maps out a realistic 90-day pilot.

Happy to send it over — no strings.

Christina
