# LinkedIn Post: Legal AI Transparency Crisis

Thomson Reuters just dropped their 2026 AI in Professional Services Report.

The headline stat that should terrify every Am Law 200 managing partner:

Only 18% of firms track AI ROI.

Meanwhile, 40% have organization-wide AI adoption. And here's the kicker — their in-house clients are getting smarter about AI faster than the firms are.

Above the Law put it bluntly this week: sophisticated in-house teams are now using AI to benchmark what legal work *actually* costs. When a contract review takes 2 hours with AI instead of 40... that $100K flat fee starts looking real questionable.

Baker McKenzie just cut 600-1,000 support staff. Explicitly citing AI.

The disruption isn't coming from legal tech startups. It's coming from your own clients figuring out you're overcharging.

Firms that get ahead of this are doing three things:
→ Deploying AI agents for repeatable work (contract review, due diligence, compliance screening)
→ Measuring and reporting AI impact to clients proactively
→ Shifting to value-based pricing before clients force their hand

The ones that don't? They're the next Baker McKenzie headline.

We help firms implement AI agents that actually work — not another shelfware platform. Real automation. Measurable results. Week 1 demo.

DM "legal" if you want to see what this looks like for your practice.
