# LinkedIn Post: SEC AI Governance Priority Shift

The SEC just told us what keeps them up at night.

And for the first time in 5 years, it's not crypto.

Their 2026 examination priorities put AI and cybersecurity at the TOP of the risk list. Ahead of digital assets. Ahead of market structure.

Here's what that means for mid-market companies:

→ AI governance isn't optional anymore — it's exam-ready or get examined
→ "Shadow AI" — employees deploying agents without IT approval — is now a board-level risk
→ Okta just launched a tool specifically to detect unauthorized AI agents in your org
→ Regulations that used to apply only to Fortune 500 are hitting mid-market this year

The companies winning in 2026 aren't the ones deploying the most AI.

They're the ones deploying AI they can actually govern.

We help regulated enterprises go from "AI chaos" to "AI confidence" — governance frameworks, managed agent deployment, and compliance baked in from day one.

If the SEC's priorities just became your priorities, let's talk.
