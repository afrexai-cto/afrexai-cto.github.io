## Email 1 — Week of Feb 23 (5 weeks out)
**Subject:** FinTech Meetup — AI agents for compliance (not chatbots)

Hi [First Name],

Saw you'll be at FinTech Meetup in Vegas — us too.

Quick context: we build managed AI agent workforces for financial services firms. Not chatbots. Actual autonomous agents handling compliance workflows, document processing, and regulatory reporting.

One client saved $60K/month by replacing 3 manual compliance review processes with agents that run 24/7. Another cut their KYC screening time from 4 hours to 11 minutes.

Would love 20 minutes at the event to show you what we're building. No pitch deck — just a live demo on a laptop.

Worth a coffee?

## Email 2 — Week of Mar 9 (3 weeks out)
**Subject:** Re: FinTech Meetup — quick question

Hi [First Name],

Following up — wanted to share something relevant before Vegas.

Goldman Sachs just deployed AI agents with Anthropic for their accounting and compliance workflows (CNBC, Feb 6). The shift from chatbots to autonomous agents is happening fast in financial services.

We're seeing the same pattern with mid-market firms — they tried chatbots in 2024, got disappointed, and now want agents that actually complete tasks end-to-end.

If that resonates, I'd love to compare notes at the event. Even 15 minutes over coffee.

Either way — see you there.

Christina

## Decision Needed from Kalin
1. Is Christina attending FinTech Meetup Las Vegas (Mar 30-Apr 1)?
2. Budget for attendance (~$2K registration + travel)
3. Should we use the meetings platform to pre-book sessions?
