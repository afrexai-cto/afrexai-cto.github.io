**Subject:** The pilot-to-production problem nobody talks about

Hi [First Name],

Quick question — how many AI pilots has [Company] run in the last 12 months?

Here's why I ask. New data from Forbes and Digital Watch Observatory confirms what we're seeing across every vertical: enterprises are confident about AI strategy but stuck scaling beyond pilots. The context gap — not the model — is what kills production deployments.

Three things we keep finding:
1. Public data gets you a demo. Organisational data gets you production. Most pilots never bridge that gap.
2. Governance isn't optional anymore. NIST just launched its AI Agent Standards Initiative. Ungoverned agents are becoming audit liabilities.
3. The 95% failure rate (MIT) isn't about bad technology. It's about missing implementation expertise.

We built AfrexAI specifically for companies in this position — AI strategy is clear, but production deployment stalls because internal teams don't have the implementation playbook.

Our CEO Christina Beckford would be happy to walk through how we've taken clients from pilot to production in under 3 weeks: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
Kalin Smolichki
CTO, AfrexAI
