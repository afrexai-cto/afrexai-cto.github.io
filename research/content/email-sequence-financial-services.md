## Email 1 — Day 1: The Regulatory Wake-Up Call

**Subject:** {Company}'s AI compliance gap before {Regulation} hits

**Body:**

{FirstName},

Quick question: does {Company} have documented AI governance covering bias testing, model monitoring, and audit trails?

If not, you're not alone — but the window is closing. Between Colorado SB 205, the EU AI Act, and SEC's AI disclosure requirements, regulators are moving faster than most firms' compliance teams can track.

We help financial services firms stand up AI governance frameworks in weeks, not quarters. One mid-market bank went from zero AI documentation to audit-ready in 21 days.

The firms that get this right early won't just avoid fines — they'll move faster than competitors still stuck in committee.

Would it make sense to compare notes for 15 minutes?

## Email 2 — Day 4: The Competitive Angle

**Subject:** Re: {Company}'s AI compliance gap

**Body:**

{FirstName},

One thing I didn't mention — the firms we work with aren't just buying compliance. They're using AI governance as the foundation to actually deploy AI at scale.

Think about it: once you have proper model monitoring, bias testing, and audit trails, you can greenlight AI projects that are currently stuck in legal review. Compliance becomes a speed advantage, not a bottleneck.

{Stat} — that's the gap between firms with AI governance and those without.

We built a 3-week implementation specifically for financial services. Happy to walk through how it maps to {Company}'s stack.

## Email 3 — Day 9: The Graceful Exit + Free Value

**Subject:** Re: {Company}'s AI compliance gap

**Body:**

{FirstName},

I'll keep this short — I know timing matters more than persistence.

I put together a quick AI governance readiness checklist specifically for {Role}s in financial services. It covers the 7 areas regulators are actually checking (not the 50 items consultants pad their SOWs with).

Here it is: [link to checklist/playbook]

If the timing isn't right for a conversation, no worries at all. But if {Company} starts an AI governance initiative in Q2-Q3, I'd love to be in the conversation.

Either way, the checklist is yours.
