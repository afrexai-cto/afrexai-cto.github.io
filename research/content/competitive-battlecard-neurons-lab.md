- **Focus:** Agentic AI consulting for Financial Services Institutions (FSIs)
- **Clients:** Visa, AXA, SMFG (claimed)
- **Experience:** 100+ AI projects since 2019
- **Positioning:** "AI-exclusive development company" — systems integrator + consultancy

- Enterprise logos (Visa, AXA) = instant credibility
- AWS partnership = procurement shortcut for AWS-heavy orgs
- Strong SEO/content marketing machine
- Multi-geography (UK, Singapore, NA, Europe, Asia)

## Where AfrexAI Wins
| Dimension | Neurons Lab | AfrexAI |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Approach** | Build custom AI tools | Managed AI workforce (ongoing) |
| **Revenue model** | Project-based (one-off) | Recurring managed services (sticky) |
| **Governance** | Add-on / afterthought | Built-in from day one |
| **Vertical depth** | FSI primary, others secondary | FSI + Legal + Healthcare (3 deep verticals) |
| **Speed** | Enterprise timelines | "Week I Win" — demo in 7 days |
| **Size advantage** | Mid-large enterprise only | Mid-market sweet spot ($500M-$5B) that Big 4 ignores |
| **ROI measurement** | Not differentiated | Built into every engagement |
| **Pricing** | Likely $200-500/hr consulting | Fixed-price outcomes ($140K-$800K ACV) |

## Key Objection Handlers

**"Neurons Lab has Visa/AXA as clients"**
→ "Great firms build tools. We run them. When Neurons Lab delivers a project, you need a team to maintain it. We ARE that team — permanently, at a fraction of the cost of internal AI staff."

**"They have 100+ projects"**
→ "100 projects delivered ≠ 100 projects still running. Our model is managed services — we don't hand off and walk away. Every client we sign is a client we keep."

**"They're AWS partners"**
→ "We're cloud-agnostic. Your AI shouldn't be locked to one vendor's ecosystem. We deploy what works best for YOUR stack."

## Displacement Strategy
1. Target their missed segment: mid-market FSIs ($500M-$5B) too small for Neurons Lab's enterprise focus
2. Lead with managed services angle: "You don't need another consulting project. You need AI that runs itself."
3. Governance-first pitch: "Treasury just released the FS AI RMF. Is your AI implementation compliant? We build governance in, not bolt it on."
4. Speed: "7-day demo vs 3-month scoping exercise"

## Use In Outreach
When a prospect mentions Neurons Lab or similar competitors:
- Acknowledge their strength, then pivot to our differentiation
- Never trash-talk — position as "different model, better fit for mid-market"
- Key line: "They build AI. We run AI. Which do you actually need?"
