## Email 1 of 3 (New Exec Nurture Sequence)

**Subject:** AI governance before April 3 — quick question, Sonney

**Body:**

Sonney — congrats on the UVA Health CIO role. Three weeks in, so I'll keep this short.

The HHS AI governance mandate hits April 3. Every health system needs bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, and human oversight frameworks in place. Most CIOs we talk to inherited zero infrastructure for this.

We build managed AI agents for health systems — the kind that handle clinical documentation, claims processing, and compliance workflows while staying inside your governance guardrails. Our clients typically see 40-60% time savings on documentation and measurable compliance improvements within 90 days.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense? Happy to share how one system stood up HHS-compliant AI agents in under 8 weeks.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 (Day 4 — Case Study)

**Subject:** Re: AI governance before April 3

How one health system deployed AI agents for clinical documentation in 8 weeks — full HHS compliance from day one. 

Saved 12 hours/week per provider on documentation. Claims denial rate dropped 23%.

Happy to walk through the specifics if useful.

## Email 3 (Day 8 — Close)

**Subject:** Re: AI governance before April 3

Sonney — last note on this. We're taking on 2 more health system clients this quarter for managed AI agent deployments.

If UVA Health is evaluating AI implementation partners, I'd love 15 minutes to show you what we've built. If the timing's off, no worries at all.

— Christina

## Notes
- UVA Health is an academic medical center = innovation mandate + research budget + HHS deadline pressure
- Sapra has CHCIO cert = he speaks the compliance language, lean into governance angle
- CEO Mitch Rosner specifically mentioned AI in his appointment announcement = top-down AI mandate
- 3 weeks in = peak "quick win" window, needs to show early results
- ACV estimate: $200K-$500K
