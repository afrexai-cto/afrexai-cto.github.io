**Hook:** 87% of General Counsel say risk is accelerating faster than they can hire.

**Body:**

The FTI/Relativity General Counsel Report just dropped. The numbers:

→ 87% say risk and demand are accelerating
→ 60% say operations got MORE complicated this year
→ 20+ categories driving increased workload
→ 1/3 say their environment is more unpredictable than ever

And here's the part nobody talks about: these legal departments aren't short on talent because they're bad at recruiting. They're short on talent because the work is multiplying faster than humans can.

Contract review. Regulatory monitoring. Compliance tracking. Discovery prep. Risk assessment.

Every one of those can be handled by an AI agent today. Not "someday." Today.

The firms that figure this out in 2026 will have a structural advantage for the next decade. The ones that don't will keep throwing bodies at a problem that bodies can't solve.

We build managed AI workforces for legal teams. Not chatbots. Not "AI-powered search." Actual agents that do the work.

If your legal department is drowning in volume, let's talk.
