# LinkedIn Post: 40% Failure Rate (Christina / AfrexAI Page)

Gartner says 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027.

Not paused. Canceled.

Having worked with enterprises on AI implementation, I can tell you exactly why:

→ They start with a strategy deck instead of a workflow
→ They hand it to IT and wait for magic
→ They measure "adoption" instead of dollars saved
→ They buy platforms when they need partners

The companies getting real ROI? They do the opposite.

Pick one painful process. Automate it. Prove value in 30 days. Then expand.

We had a client pay us $111K before we even built the solution. Why? Because the approach — start small, prove ROI, scale what works — was so obviously right they didn't want to wait.

The gap between "planning to use AI" and "getting results" is massive right now.

That gap is the entire opportunity.

If you're an executive watching your AI budget grow without proportional results — that's not an AI problem. That's an implementation problem.

And implementation problems have solutions.
