# Email Sequence: "The AI ROI Measurement Gap" (3-Touch)
*Target: CFOs and COOs at mid-market financial services firms ($500M-$5B revenue)*
*Hook: Even McKinsey can't measure AI ROI — we can because we focus on outcomes, not experiments*

## Email 1: Day 0 — "McKinsey has 40,000 AI agents. They still can't measure ROI."

**Subject:** Your AI budget is probably a black hole

Hi {{first_name}},

Business Insider just reported that McKinsey, PwC, EY, and BCG — firms that sell AI consulting — can't measure the ROI of their own AI agents.

McKinsey has 40,000. They're still figuring out what they're worth.

If the world's top consulting firms can't quantify AI value internally, what chance does a {{industry}} firm have with a generic pilot program?

The problem isn't AI. It's implementation without measurement baked in from day one.

We build AI agent systems for financial services firms with three things most consultants skip:
1. Baseline metrics captured before deployment
2. Outcome tracking tied to specific business KPIs (not "productivity")
3. Monthly ROI reports your board can actually read

One compliance team went from 12-hour manual reviews to 45-minute AI-assisted reviews. That's not a productivity estimate — it's a measured outcome.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if your AI investments are actually paying off?

Best,

## Email 2: Day 5 — "The $2.3M question nobody's asking"

**Subject:** Re: Your AI budget is probably a black hole

{{first_name}},

Quick follow-up. Here's the math most firms skip:

A mid-market financial services firm typically spends $800K-$2.3M annually on compliance labor that AI agents can handle. Not replace humans — handle the grunt work so your team focuses on judgment calls.

But here's what makes the difference: firms that implement AI with ROI tracking from day one see 3-4x faster executive buy-in for expansion. Because they can prove it works.

Firms that implement "AI pilots" without measurement? They get defunded in Q3.

We've built a 5-minute AI ROI readiness assessment specific to financial services. It shows you exactly where your highest-value automation opportunities are and what measurable returns look like.

Want me to send it over?

## Email 3: Day 12 — "Before your board asks"

**Subject:** Board AI question you'll get in Q2

{{first_name}},

By Q2, every board is going to ask: "What's our AI actually doing for us?"

Two types of answers:
1. "We have several pilot programs showing promising results" (translation: we don't know)
2. "Our AI agents processed 14,000 compliance checks last quarter, reducing review time by 73% and saving $420K in labor costs" (translation: we measured it)

Which answer do you want to give?

We help financial services firms get to answer #2 in 90 days. Fixed scope, measurable outcomes, no pilot purgatory.

Here's our compliance AI readiness assessment if you want to see where you stand: [LINK]

Happy to walk through it live if useful.
