*Topic: Microsoft Copilot reading confidential emails — governance wake-up call*

---

Microsoft just confirmed that a bug in Copilot allowed their AI to read and summarize emails marked as confidential.

For four weeks.

Including privileged legal communications in Drafts and Sent Items.

Their response? "It didn't give anyone access to information they weren't already authorized to see."

That's technically true. And completely beside the point.

The issue isn't who saw what. It's that the governance controls failed silently. For a month. And Microsoft won't say how many organizations were affected.

Now layer on:
→ NIST just launched an AI Agent Standards Initiative
→ Firms are deploying autonomous agents that can read, write, and act
→ Most have zero audit trail for what those agents actually access

If your AI governance strategy is "trust the vendor's defaults" — this week proved that's not a strategy.

The firms that win in 2026 aren't the ones deploying AI fastest. They're the ones deploying it with governance that actually works when something goes wrong.
