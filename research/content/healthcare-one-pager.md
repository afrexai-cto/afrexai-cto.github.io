# AI Agents for Healthcare — One Page Brief

## The Problem

Healthcare systems are drowning. Clinical documentation eats 2+ hours per physician per day. Claims denials cost the average hospital $5M annually. Compliance teams are stretched thin — and the **HHS AI governance mandate hits April 3, 2026**.

Meanwhile, your competitors are already deploying AI. 66% of healthcare CEOs report measurable GenAI ROI (IDC 2025).

## What We Do

AfrexAI deploys **managed AI agent workforces** for healthcare operations — not chatbots, not copilots, actual autonomous agents that do real work:

- **Clinical Documentation Agents** — reduce physician admin burden by 60-70%
- **Claims Processing Agents** — catch denials before submission, recover $2-5M/year
- **Compliance Monitoring Agents** — continuous regulatory surveillance, HHS-ready governance
- **Patient Communication Agents** — scheduling, follow-ups, no-show reduction (proven 30%+ improvement)

## Why AfrexAI vs. DIY or Big Tech

| | AfrexAI | DIY / Internal Team | Big Tech (Epic, Cerner) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time to value | 2-4 weeks | 6-18 months | 12-24 months |
| Cost | $120K-$500K/yr | $500K-$2M+ (salaries) | $1M+ (licenses + integration) |
| HIPAA-ready | Day 1 | You build it | Varies |
| HHS governance | Built-in | You figure it out | Bolt-on |
| Customization | Full | Full (if you can staff it) | Limited |

## The HHS Deadline (April 3, 2026)

All HHS divisions must adopt AI governance practices covering:
- Bias mitigation and fairness monitoring
- Clinical outcome tracking
- Security and access controls
- Human oversight frameworks

**This isn't optional.** Health systems working with federal programs need governance NOW. Our agents come with governance baked in — audit trails, bias monitoring, human-in-the-loop by default.

## Pricing

| Tier | What You Get | Investment |
|---|---|---|
| **Accelerate** | 2-3 AI agents, one department | $120K-$180K/yr |
| **Transform** | 5-8 agents, cross-department | $250K-$500K/yr |
| **Strategic** | Full AI workforce, org-wide | $500K-$800K+/yr |

All tiers include: implementation, training, 24/7 monitoring, quarterly optimization, compliance reporting.

## Proof Points

- Every $1 invested in AI → $3.70 return (Google Cloud)
