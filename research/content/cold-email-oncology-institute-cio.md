# Cold Email — New CIO, The Oncology Institute
*Drafted: 2026-02-18 | ACV Target: $120K-$250K*

**Context:** The Oncology Institute (100+ clinics, cancer care specialist) just appointed a new CIO who previously served as VP of healthcare information services and spearheaded cloud/AI transition. Classic "new exec quick win" pattern.

Hi [First Name],

Saw your appointment at The Oncology Institute — congratulations. Moving from cloud/AI transformation at startup speed to 100+ oncology clinics is a different beast entirely.

Here's what I've seen trip up new healthcare CIOs: the gap between "we need AI" (everyone agrees) and "we have AI working in production" (nobody knows how to get there). Especially with the HHS AI governance mandate landing April 3.

We close that gap. Our managed AI agents handle clinical documentation, claims processing, and compliance monitoring — deployed in weeks, not quarters. One health system went live in 3 weeks flat.

You've got a board review coming. Having production AI agents running across 100+ clinics before that review would be a strong signal.

20 minutes to see if it fits?

**Notes:**
- 100+ clinics = scale story (agents across locations)
- Oncology = high regulatory scrutiny, HHS mandate very relevant
- New CIO from startup background = values speed
