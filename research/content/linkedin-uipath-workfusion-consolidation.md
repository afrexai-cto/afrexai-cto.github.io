# LinkedIn Post — UiPath/WorkFusion: What Mid-Market Firms Should Know

UiPath just acquired WorkFusion.

If you're a mid-market bank or fintech relying on WorkFusion for AML/KYC compliance automation — pay attention.

Here's what happens when enterprise vendors consolidate:

→ Prices go up (UiPath isn't known for being cheap)
→ Product roadmaps shift to serve the acquirer's biggest customers
→ Support quality drops for smaller accounts
→ Your compliance tooling becomes a feature inside a massive platform you didn't sign up for

WorkFusion built solid AI agents for financial crime compliance. But now those agents serve UiPath's strategy, not yours.

The pattern is familiar. Big vendor buys specialist. Specialist gets absorbed. Mid-market customers get squeezed.

If your compliance team is watching this and thinking "we need a backup plan" — you're not paranoid. You're smart.

Three things to consider:

1. Map your WorkFusion dependency. What breaks if pricing doubles next renewal?
2. Evaluate purpose-built alternatives NOW, while you have leverage
3. Look at managed AI agent providers who stay focused on your vertical — not everyone's vertical

The firms that move first get the best terms. The ones that wait get the migration bill.
