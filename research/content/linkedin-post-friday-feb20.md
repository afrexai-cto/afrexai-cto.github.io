McKinsey has "tens of thousands" of internal AI agents. They're planning one per employee.

And they still can't measure the ROI.

A former McKinsey partner literally called this "the age of confusion."

Meanwhile, Microsoft's AI chief says most white-collar tasks will be fully automated in 12-18 months.

So here's the gap:

Every enterprise knows AI is coming. Most are experimenting. Almost none are getting real results at scale.

The problem isn't the technology. It's the implementation.

95% of AI pilots fail — not because the AI doesn't work, but because nobody bridges the gap between "cool demo" and "runs in production without breaking compliance."

That's the only job that matters right now.

Not building another chatbot. Not another AI strategy deck. Actually deploying AI agents that do real work, within real regulatory constraints, at real scale.

The companies that figure this out first get a structural advantage that compounds for years.

The rest get to watch.
