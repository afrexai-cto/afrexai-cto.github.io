**Target:** Community bank execs, fintech leaders, weekend readers
**Angle:** OCC RFI + CSP lock-in = opportunity for independent AI implementation partners

Community banks have an AI problem. But it's not what you think.

It's not that they don't want AI. 27% of community bank leaders now rank it as their #1 priority (CSI 2026 Survey).

The problem is their core service providers.

Three CSPs serve over 70% of US depository institutions. And according to the ABA's 2024 Core Platforms Survey, innovation capabilities scored *below average* — 3.19 out of 5.

The OCC just released an RFI highlighting what community bankers already know:

→ AI is being embedded into fraud monitoring and underwriting as black boxes
→ Banks can't validate model logic, training data, or governance
→ Legacy core systems block data access with proprietary formats and restrictive APIs
→ Compliance exposure is growing under fair lending laws

Meanwhile, large banks and fintechs are deploying ML across lending, operations, and customer engagement at scale.

The gap isn't awareness. It's implementation.

Community banks need AI partners who:
- Work independently of their CSP's roadmap
- Provide transparent, auditable AI governance
- Build to NIST AI Agent Standards (launched this week)
- Deliver outcomes, not another dashboard

The banks that solve this in 2026 will pull ahead. The ones waiting for their core provider to "add AI" will keep waiting.
