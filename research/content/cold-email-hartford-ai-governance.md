*Draft for ksmolichki@afrexai.com — DO NOT SEND without approval*

**To:** Jeffery Hawkins, Chief Data, AI & Operations Officer, The Hartford
**Subject:** CT SB-2 cure period ends June 30 — quick question on your AI governance stack

---

Jeffery,

Congrats on the expanded role — leading both data/AI and operations at The Hartford is a big remit.

Quick question: with CT SB-2's 60-day cure period closing June 30 and Bulletin MC-25 already requiring AI transparency from CT insurers, how are you handling the governance layer across your underwriting and claims models?

We've been working with carriers on exactly this — building AI governance frameworks that satisfy both the letter of SB-2 (developer/deployer obligations, AG enforcement) and the spirit (transparent, auditable AI decisions that actually improve loss ratios).

Not selling anything here. But if you're evaluating governance tooling or frameworks for your AI stack, happy to share what's working at other carriers — no strings.

Either way, would love to hear how Hartford is approaching this. You're clearly ahead of most with the dedicated CDAIO role.

Best,
[AfrexAI signature]

**Why this works:**
- References his specific new role (shows research)
- CT SB-2 urgency is real and time-bound
- "Not selling" frame reduces resistance
- Positions as peer sharing intel, not vendor pitching
- The Hartford just restructured for AI — they're spending money NOW
