# LinkedIn Post: Banks Are Done With Chatbots

Banks are finally done pretending chatbots are AI strategy.

PYMNTS just reported: financial institutions are shifting from chatbots to autonomous AI agents that handle end-to-end workflows — compliance, treasury, fraud detection.

This isn't incremental. It's a fundamental shift in how banks operate.

The chatbot era (2020-2025): "Ask me anything!" → deflects 40% of calls → saves some money → nobody's impressed.

The agent era (2026+): AI agents that actually DO the work. Screen KYC applications. Flag suspicious transactions. Generate regulatory reports. Monitor compliance gaps in real-time.

The ABA Banking Journal is talking about "autonomous, interconnected agents managing fraud, compliance, and client services in real time."

That's not a future prediction. That's happening now.

Three things banks should know:

1. You don't need to build this from scratch. Pre-trained compliance agents exist.
2. Start with ONE workflow. KYC screening is the lowest-risk, highest-ROI entry point.
3. The ROI math is brutal — $200K/year in analyst time replaced by agents that cost a fraction.

The question isn't whether your bank will use AI agents. It's whether you'll be first or last in your market.
