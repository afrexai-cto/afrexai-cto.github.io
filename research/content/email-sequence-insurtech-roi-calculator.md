## Email 1 — Day 0: The Calculator Hook

**Subject:** Your AI compliance exposure in 60 seconds

Hi {{first_name}},

Colorado's expanded AI governance regulation (Reg 10-1-1) now covers auto and health benefit insurers — and other states are following fast.

We built a free calculator that shows carriers exactly what non-compliance costs. Takes 60 seconds, no email required:

→ [AI Compliance ROI Calculator]

For a carrier writing ${{premium_volume}} in premium across {{states}} states, the typical exposure is $2-5M in fines, exam costs, and remediation — before you factor in license risk.

Worth a look?

## Email 2 — Day 3: The Stat Bomb

**Subject:** Re: Your AI compliance exposure in 60 seconds

{{first_name}} — one number that caught my attention:

Carriers that started governance programs in 2025 are now using them as competitive advantages — winning agent appointments and regulatory trust that late movers can't buy.

The ones scrambling to catch up? Average remediation: 4-6 months and $1.2M+.

We've helped carriers go from zero governance to audit-ready in 3 weeks. Not 3 months. 3 weeks.

Happy to show you how — 15 minutes?

## Email 3 — Day 7: The Case Study

**Subject:** How a 12-state carrier got audit-ready in 19 days

{{first_name}},

Quick case: regional P&C carrier, 12 states, 4 AI models in underwriting. No documentation, no bias testing, no governance framework.

3 weeks later:
- Full model inventory + risk classification
- Bias testing framework across all protected classes  
- Regulator-ready documentation package
- Board-level reporting dashboard
- Staff trained on ongoing compliance

Total cost: less than one market conduct exam.

Your situation might be simpler or more complex — but the 3-week timeline holds. We've done it enough times to know.

15 minutes to see if it fits?

## Email 4 — Day 14: The Breakup

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

{{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about AI compliance for {{company}}. No response tells me one of three things:

1. You've already got governance handled — great, ignore this
2. It's not a priority right now — fair, but Reg 10-1-1 enforcement is live
3. Wrong person — mind pointing me to whoever handles AI risk?

Either way, no hard feelings. The ROI calculator is still free if you want to run your numbers: [link]
