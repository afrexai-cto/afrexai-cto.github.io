# 3-Part Email Sequence: CSP Lock-In → Independent AI Partner
**Target:** Community bank CEOs, COOs, CTOs ($500M-$5B assets)
**Angle:** Your core provider's AI roadmap isn't your AI roadmap

## Email 1: The Lock-In Problem

**Subject:** Your core provider's AI timeline vs. yours

Hi [First Name],

Quick question — when did your core service provider last ship an AI feature you actually wanted?

The OCC just released data showing what community bankers already know: the big three CSPs serve 70%+ of depository institutions, but their innovation scores sit below average (ABA, 3.19/5).

Meanwhile, 27% of community bank leaders now rank AI as their top priority for 2026.

That's a gap. And it's growing.

We help community banks deploy AI agents for compliance, operations, and customer engagement — independently of their core provider's roadmap. No black boxes. Full governance. Built to the new NIST AI Agent Standards.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense? I can show you what a bank your size typically automates first.

Best,

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 5)

**Subject:** How one community bank cut compliance review time 40%

Hi [First Name],

Following up — wanted to share something concrete.

A $2B community bank we worked with was spending 120+ hours/month on BSA/AML case reviews. Their core provider's "AI" was a rules engine with a 60% false positive rate.

We deployed 3 AI agents alongside their existing stack (no core migration needed):
- Agent 1: Automated initial case triage — cut false positives by 45%
- Agent 2: Document assembly for SARs — from 4 hours to 40 minutes
- Agent 3: Regulatory change monitoring — flagged OCC updates same-day

Total time saved: ~50 hours/month. Cost: less than one FTE.

The key? We work WITH your core system, not instead of it. No rip-and-replace. No 18-month migration.

Happy to walk through what this would look like for [Bank Name].

## Email 3: The Urgency (Day 10)

**Subject:** NIST just changed the AI compliance timeline

Hi [First Name],

Last thing from me — the NIST Center for AI Standards and Innovation just launched their AI Agent Standards Initiative. RFIs, guidelines, and audit frameworks are coming in months, not years.

For community banks already using AI (even through their CSP), this means:
- Every AI model touching customer data will need documented governance
- Black-box implementations from core providers create audit liability
- Regulators will ask: "Can you explain how this decision was made?"

Banks that build governance in NOW will pass audits cleanly. Banks that wait will face 6-figure remediation.

We build AI governance into every deployment from day one. It's not an add-on — it's the foundation.

Worth a conversation?
