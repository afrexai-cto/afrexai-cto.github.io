# Candescent AXIS 2026 — Attendance Strategy
*Created: 2026-02-21*

## Event Details
- **When:** April 21-23, 2026
- **Where:** Orlando, FL
- **Theme:** "Connected Brilliance" — Intelligent Banking
- **Audience:** Bank + credit union leaders, partners, fintech vendors
- **Registration:** https://events.candescent.com/CandescentAXIS26

## Why This Is Priority #1 Conference
- Candescent (formerly NCR Digital Banking) serves community banks — our EXACT ICP
- "Client and partner community" event = warm audience, not cold
- Fraud, compliance, AI operations all on-agenda
- Intimate enough for real conversations (not 10K+ mega-conf)

## Action Plan
1. **Register Christina ASAP** — partner/vendor registration if available
2. **Inquire about speaking slots** — topic: "From AI Pilot to AI Workforce in Community Banking"
3. **Prepare one-pager** specifically for community bank audience
4. **Pre-event outreach** — identify attendees on LinkedIn, start conversations before April
5. **Book meetings** — use event as excuse to reach out to community bank CIOs/CTOs

## Budget Estimate
- Registration: TBD (likely $500-2,000 for non-clients)
- Travel (UK→Orlando): ~$1,500 flights + $600 hotel (3 nights)
- Total: ~$2,500-4,000

## ROI Case
- One community bank deal = $120K-250K
- Need 1 conversation that converts = 25-60x ROI on conference cost
