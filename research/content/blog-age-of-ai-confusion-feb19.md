## McKinsey Has 40,000 AI Agents. They Still Can't Measure ROI.

Last week, Business Insider reported something that should make every mid-market executive sit up:

The world's largest consulting firms — McKinsey, PwC, EY, BCG — have deployed thousands of AI agents. McKinsey alone plans one agent per employee.

And they're all asking the same question: **"Is this actually working?"**

Mina Alaghband, a former McKinsey partner now at Writer, called it **"the age of confusion."**

A year ago, everyone tracked adoption metrics — how many people logged in, how often tools were used. Vanity metrics.

Now the conversation has shifted to value: How much human labor was freed? Did revenue go up? Are consultants doing better work?

**The uncomfortable truth:** Most firms can't answer these questions.

## What This Means for Mid-Market Companies

If McKinsey — with unlimited budget, top-tier talent, and direct access to AI labs — is struggling to prove AI ROI...

What chance does a 500-person financial services firm have going it alone?

This isn't a criticism. It's a reality check.

The AI implementation gap is real:
- **95% of AI pilots fail** to reach production (MIT)
- **76% of enterprises** want to buy AI solutions, not build them (Gartner)
- The average enterprise has **3-5 failed AI projects** before finding what works

## The Difference Between AI Confusion and AI Revenue

Companies generating real returns from AI share three things:

### 1. They measure outcomes, not adoption
Not "how many people used the tool" but "how many hours of compliance review did we eliminate?"

### 2. They start with the highest-value process
Not a company-wide AI strategy. One process. One agent. Measurable results in 30 days.

### 3. They have an implementation partner, not a vendor
The Big 4 sell strategy decks. Implementation partners ship working agents.

## The Numbers That Matter

When AI is implemented right:
- **Every $1 invested → $3.70 return** (Google Cloud)
- **Klarna:** $60M saved, 700 FTEs replaced, resolution time cut from 11 minutes to 2
- **66% of CEOs** report measurable GenAI ROI — but only those who went beyond pilots (IDC 2025)

## What to Do About It

If you're a mid-market firm ($50M-$5B revenue) in financial services, legal, or healthcare:

1. **Stop buying AI platforms.** Start buying AI outcomes.
2. **Pick one process** that costs you $500K+/year in manual labor.
3. **Run a 30-day proof of concept** with measurable KPIs.
4. **Scale what works.** Kill what doesn't.
