**Subject:** 68% deployed AI agents. How many are audit-ready by April 3?

Hi [First Name],

Quick stat that caught my eye: 68% of healthcare organizations have now deployed agentic AI — making it the third most adopted AI application in the sector.

But here's what nobody's talking about: the HHS mandate hitting April 3 requires AI governance practices across all divisions. Bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security protocols, human oversight.

Most of those deployments were built for speed, not compliance. That's a problem with a 6-week deadline.

We help healthcare organizations get their AI deployments audit-ready — typically in 3 weeks. Not by ripping anything out, but by wrapping governance around what's already running.

Would it be worth a 20-minute call with our CEO Christina Beckford to see if this applies to your current setup?

Best,
Kalin Smolichki
CTO, AfrexAI

**Why this works:**
- Specific stat (68%) grabs attention — it's their world
- HHS April 3 deadline creates genuine urgency (not manufactured)
- "3 weeks" vs "6 weeks left" makes the math obvious
- Doesn't sell — asks if it applies
- Short, scannable, no AI-speak
