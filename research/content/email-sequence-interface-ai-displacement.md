# Email Sequence: interface.ai Competitive Displacement
*Created: 2026-02-21*
*Target: Credit unions and community banks currently using or evaluating interface.ai*

## Positioning
interface.ai sells point solutions (Voice AI, Chat AI, Collections AI). AfrexAI delivers managed AI operations — governance, multi-function agents, compliance baked in. They sell tools. We run operations.

## Email 1: "Your AI chatbot is a feature, not a strategy"

**Subject:** Your AI vendor is building features. You need operations.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

interface.ai just launched their third product in two months. Smart Collections, Telarus partnership, BankGPT rebrand.

Sounds impressive until you realize what's happening: they're selling you separate AI tools that don't talk to each other.

A voice bot here. A chat widget there. A collections agent over there. Three vendors worth of complexity from one company — and you're still the one connecting the dots.

We work with community banks differently. Instead of bolting on AI features, we deploy managed AI operations: agents that handle compliance documentation, regulatory reporting, member communications, and back-office workflows as one coordinated system.

The difference? Our clients don't manage AI. They manage outcomes.

Would it be worth 20 minutes to see how [Bank Name] could consolidate AI operations instead of collecting AI tools?

## Email 2 (Day 5): "The governance gap your AI vendor won't mention"

**Subject:** Quick question about your AI governance framework

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

One thing I've noticed with banks using point-solution AI: nobody's thinking about governance until the examiner asks.

When you have separate AI systems for voice, chat, and collections — who owns the audit trail? Who validates the model isn't creating fair lending risk? Who documents decisions for OCC/NCUA review?

Your AI vendor builds features. They don't build governance frameworks.

We do. Every agent we deploy comes with:
- Decision audit trails for examiner review
- Bias monitoring and fair lending compliance checks
- Model documentation that satisfies NIST AI RMF
- Human escalation protocols with full context preservation

Two of our financial services clients went through regulatory review with zero findings on their AI systems. Their examiners actually commented on the documentation quality.

Worth a conversation?

## Email 3 (Day 10): "The $200K question"

**Subject:** What happens when your AI vendor pivots?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

interface.ai has launched 4 new products in 90 days. That's exciting — and also a red flag.

When a vendor sprints that fast, priorities shift. Today you're a valued client. Tomorrow you're on the legacy product while resources move to the shiny new thing.

We've seen this play out at three banks this quarter. They invested $150-250K in AI tools, then spent another $80K+ trying to make them work together. One is now on their third AI vendor in two years.

Our approach: one managed AI operations partner. We deploy, maintain, govern, and evolve. You don't switch vendors when the technology changes — we handle the evolution.

If that resonates, I'd love to show you what managed AI operations looks like for a bank your size.

## Target List
Pull from: community banks and credit unions in the $500M-$5B asset range that have publicly mentioned AI initiatives or interface.ai partnerships. Check NCUA and OCC call reports for institutions investing in technology.

## Notes
- Never name interface.ai directly in the emails — let readers connect dots
- Focus on governance gap — this is where point solutions genuinely fall short
- Christina sends these, not Kalin
- CTA always = Calendly booking
