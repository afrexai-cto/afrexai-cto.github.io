# Finserv Compliance Governance — 3-Email Sequence
*Created: 2026-02-19 21:57 GMT | Target: Compliance leaders at mid-market financial services*

## Trigger Context
Luware article (Feb 2026): Firms struggled in 2025 to explain AI outputs at audits, recreate AI-assisted decisions, or prove how AI influenced outcomes. "AI without governance fails compliance."

## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your AI compliance tools can't explain themselves yet

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question — if a regulator asked your team tomorrow to explain exactly how an AI system flagged (or missed) a suspicious transaction, could you answer in under an hour?

Most compliance teams we talk to can't. Not because the tools are bad, but because nobody built the governance layer between "AI does stuff" and "we can prove what it did."

That gap is about to get expensive. DORA, SEC AI disclosure requirements, and Basel III.1 are all converging in 2026. And regulators aren't asking "are you using AI?" anymore — they're asking "can you audit it?"

We build AI agents for financial services firms that come with full audit trails, explainability logs, and compliance-grade documentation from day one. Not a platform you have to figure out. Working systems, managed end-to-end.

Would it make sense to show you what this looks like for a compliance team like yours? 15 minutes, no pitch deck.

Best,

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 5)

**Subject:** Re: Your AI compliance tools can't explain themselves yet

Hi {{first_name}},

One stat that keeps coming up in our conversations with compliance leaders:

McKinsey has tens of thousands of internal AI agents — and even they admit they can't reliably measure ROI. A former McKinsey partner called it "the age of AI confusion."

If the Big 4 are struggling with this, mid-market firms without dedicated AI teams are in a tougher spot.

The firms we work with skip the confusion entirely. They get AI agents that are already compliant, already documented, and already delivering measurable results — usually within 30 days.

One compliance automation PoC we deployed cut KYC review time by 64% while generating complete audit logs for every decision.

Worth a conversation?

## Email 3: The Breakup (Day 12)

**Subject:** closing the loop

Hi {{first_name}},

I sent a couple of notes about AI governance for compliance teams. I know timing is everything, so if this isn't a priority right now, no worries at all.

But if your team is dealing with any of these in 2026:
- Regulators asking about AI explainability
- AI tools generating alerts without proper logging
- Pressure to adopt AI faster than governance can keep up

...we should probably talk before it becomes urgent.

Either way, I'll leave this with you. Our AI Revenue Leak Calculator might be useful even if we never connect: https://afrexai-cto.github.io/ai-revenue-calculator/

All the best,
