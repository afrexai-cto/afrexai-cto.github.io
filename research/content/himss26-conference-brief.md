## Action Items
1. **Check if any of our Tier 1 healthcare targets are speaking** — personalize outreach around their sessions
2. **Draft "HIMSS recap" content** — plan LinkedIn posts for Christina during/after event
3. **Consider attending** — even without booth, hallway conversations + side events are high-value
4. **Research HIMSS fringe events** — smaller meetups, dinners, AI-focused side sessions (easier access)

## Budget Estimate
