90% of enterprise AI projects fail.

Not because the technology doesn't work.

Because most companies skip 3 things:

**1. They pick AI for the hype, not the problem.**
Gartner says 60% of AI projects unsupported by AI-ready data will be abandoned by 2026. Most companies choose tools before defining the workflow they're fixing.

**2. They treat it as a tech project, not an operations change.**
RAND found AI fails at 2x the rate of normal IT projects. The difference? AI requires workflow redesign, not just software installation.

**3. They pilot forever and never deploy.**
BCG surveyed 1,250 executives: 60% generate zero material value from AI. Not because pilots failed — because pilots never became production systems.

The 10% that succeed?

They start with a specific $$ problem (not "let's try AI").
They redesign the workflow first, THEN add the agent.
They measure ROI from week 1, not quarter 4.

We've done this for a $111K pre-delivery engagement. The client didn't pay for "AI" — they paid for a working system that replaced 3 manual processes in 90 days.

If you're spending on AI but not seeing returns, that's not an AI problem.

It's an implementation problem.

And that's exactly what we fix.
