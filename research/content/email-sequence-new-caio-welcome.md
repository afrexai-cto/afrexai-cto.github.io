# Email Sequence: New Chief AI Officer Welcome Kit
*Created: 2026-02-21 | Target: Newly appointed CAIOs/CDIOs/Chief AI Officers*
*Angle: "You just got the hardest job in the C-suite. Here's how to win fast."*

## Why This Sequence Works
- 1/3 of all CAIO appointments happened Nov 2025-Feb 2026 (Longhouse data)
- New CAIOs have 90-day pressure to show results
- They inherit zero infrastructure, zero governance, zero playbook
- NIST standards + HHS mandates + Basel III.1 = they NEED external help NOW
- ACV target: $200K-$500K (governance framework + first agent deployment)

## Email 1 — Day 0: "The 90-Day Clock"

**Subject:** The 90-day clock just started

**Body:**

Congrats on the CAIO role — you just got the hardest job in the C-suite.

The board wants AI wins. Your teams want direction. And regulators want governance you probably don't have yet.

Here's what we've seen work for new AI leaders in regulated industries:

**Week 1-4:** AI governance framework — what's deployed, what's risky, what's shadow AI  
**Week 5-8:** First production agent — pick the highest-ROI, lowest-risk use case and ship it  
**Week 9-12:** Measurement system — prove the ROI before the board asks  

The firms that get this right in 90 days secure budget for 3 years. The ones that don't get reorganized.

We've helped new AI leaders at [financial services / healthcare / legal] firms stand up governance and deploy their first agents in under 60 days. Happy to share the playbook if useful.

Best,

## Email 2 — Day 5: "NIST Changed the Game"

**Subject:** NIST just made your job harder (and more important)

**Body:**

If you missed it: NIST launched the AI Agent Standards Initiative on Feb 20. Federal standards for AI agents — security, identity, interoperability — are coming in months, not years.

For new AI leaders, this means:

1. **Every agent deployment needs an audit trail** — retroactive compliance is 10x more expensive
2. **Your board will ask about this** — "Are we NIST-ready?" is the new "Are we SOC 2 compliant?"
3. **The window to build governance BEFORE standards hit is closing fast**

We built governance into our AI agent deployments from day one — not bolted on after. That's the difference between a $50K remediation project and a $0 one.

Worth a 20-minute call to walk through what NIST-ready looks like for [their industry]?

Best,

## Email 3 — Day 12: "The Implementation Gap"

**Subject:** 78% adopted AI. 15% scaled it. Here's what the 15% did differently.

**Body:**

Stanford's 2025 AI Index found 78% of enterprises adopted AI — but only 15% successfully scaled beyond pilots.

After working with regulated companies across financial services, healthcare, and legal, here's what separates the 15%:

- **They treated AI agents like employees** — onboarding, governance, performance reviews
- **They measured ROI from day one** — not after 6 months of "exploring"  
- **They had an implementation partner** — not a vendor, not a consultant, an actual operator

The big consultancies charge $2M+ and deliver PowerPoints. We deploy working AI agents with built-in governance for a fraction of that. And they're in production in weeks, not quarters.

If you're building your AI strategy from scratch, I'd genuinely like to help — even if it's just sharing what we've seen work. No pitch, just pattern recognition from doing this across industries.

Open to a quick call this week?

Best,
