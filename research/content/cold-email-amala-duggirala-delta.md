# Cold Email Draft: Amala Duggirala — Delta Air Lines

**To:** Amala Duggirala, Chief Digital & Technology Officer, Delta Air Lines
**From:** Christina Beckford, CEO, AfrexAI
**Subject:** Your first 90 days at Delta — quick AI win

Amala,

Congrats on the Delta appointment. Moving from USAA CIO to CDTO at the world's most profitable airline — that's a move.

Here's what I've seen with new tech executives: the board expects visible AI results before the first quarterly review. But Delta's scale (100K+ employees, 200M passengers/year) means most AI pilots take 6-12 months just to clear compliance.

We deploy managed AI agent workforces — not chatbots, not copilots, actual working agents that handle operational tasks end-to-end. Our clients typically see measurable results in 3-4 weeks:

- **Customer ops:** AI agents handling rebooking, status updates, and loyalty inquiries — cutting resolution time from 11 min to under 2 min (similar to what Klarna achieved, saving $60M)
- **Compliance documentation:** Automated FAA/DOT regulatory reporting agents
- **Internal operations:** Maintenance scheduling, crew optimization, procurement agents

We've delivered $111K in pre-delivery contracts because clients trust our implementation — 95% of AI projects fail, and we're the team that makes them work.

Would 15 minutes this week make sense? I can show you exactly what "AI results in week one" looks like at airline scale.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

**Notes:**
- ACV potential: $500K-$1M+ (enterprise airline, massive scale)
- Angle: New exec, needs quick wins, came from USAA (finserv AI background)
- Started Jan 12, 2026 — ~5 weeks in, still in "prove myself" window
- Delta = aspirational logo. Even a meeting is a win for credibility.
- Find LinkedIn: search "Amala Duggirala Delta"
- Previous role: CIO at USAA since 2022 (financial services = familiar with regulated AI)
