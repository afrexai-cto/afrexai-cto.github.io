# Email Sequence: Community Bank AI Beyond Fraud Detection
*Created: 2026-02-21 14:57 GMT | Angle: Finovifi acquisition proves banks need AI — but fraud is just the tip*

## Context
Finovifi just acquired Turner Software (50+ community bank clients) and launched FrontLine Sentry — real-time teller fraud prevention. This validates that community banks ARE buying AI solutions. But fraud detection is one workflow. The bigger opportunity is operations-wide AI.

## Email 1: "Fraud AI is table stakes. What about the other 90%?"

**Subject:** Your teller line has AI. What about everything else?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Finovifi just acquired Turner Software to bring real-time AI fraud detection to community bank teller lines. Smart move — 50+ banks are getting protected at the point of transaction.

But here's what I keep hearing from community bank leaders: fraud detection is maybe 10% of where AI could help.

What about the other 90%?

- Loan document review that takes your team 4 hours instead of 20 minutes
- BSA/AML monitoring that generates 95% false positives
- Customer onboarding that loses applicants to neobanks mid-process
- Compliance reporting that eats 2 full-time employees' worth of hours

We help community banks ($500M-$5B) deploy AI across operations — not just one workflow. No rip-and-replace. Works alongside your existing core (FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry).

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense? I can show you what a bank your size automated first — and what the ROI looked like after 90 days.

Best,

## Email 2 (Day 5): "The implementation gap is real"

**Subject:** Re: Your teller line has AI. What about everything else?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up. Wanted to share one data point:

CSI's 2026 Banking Priorities Survey found 27% of community bank leaders now rank AI as their #1 concern — ahead of cybersecurity for the first time.

But the gap between "we know AI matters" and "we have AI working in production" is where most banks get stuck.

That's exactly where we come in. We've helped regulated institutions go from zero AI to measurable ROI in under 90 days — with full compliance governance baked in from day one.

No pilots that stall. No chatbots that frustrate customers. Actual working AI agents handling real workflows.

Worth a conversation?

## Email 3 (Day 10): "NIST is watching"

**Subject:** NIST just launched AI agent standards. Ready?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Last thing — NIST's new AI Agent Standards Initiative (launched Feb 20) means federal governance frameworks for AI agents are coming fast.

Banks already deploying AI without proper governance will face remediation costs. Banks that haven't started will face even steeper compliance curves.

We build governance in from day one — explainability, audit trails, human-in-the-loop controls. Everything the regulators want to see.

Happy to share our AI Governance Readiness Checklist (free, no strings) — it maps exactly what NIST and OCC expect.

Just reply "send it" and I'll get it over.
