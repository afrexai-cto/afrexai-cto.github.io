Colorado's AI Act (SB 24-205) went live on February 1st.

If your company uses AI to make lending decisions, insurance underwriting, hiring recommendations, or any "consequential decision" about consumers — you're now regulated.

Here's what most companies are missing:

→ The AG can request your impact assessments with 90 days notice
→ Enforcement starts June 30 — that's 4.5 months away
→ "Reasonable care" isn't defined. YOU have to prove it
→ Penalties run through the Consumer Protection Act: $20K per violation, no cap
→ For an AI system making 10,000 decisions/day, do the math

The companies getting ahead of this are doing three things:

1. Continuous algorithmic discrimination monitoring (not annual audits)
2. Automated impact assessments that update as models change
3. Building documentation trails BEFORE the AG asks

The ones who wait will be the cautionary tales at next year's compliance conferences.

If you're in fintech, insurtech, or any industry deploying AI in Colorado — the clock started 15 days ago.
