## Email 1: The Coordination Problem (Day 0)

**Subject:** $177B in construction waste — your projects don't have to contribute

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: how many hours does your team spend each week chasing submittals, coordinating subs, and reconciling schedules across Procore, PlanGrid, and email?

For most mid-market contractors, the answer is "too many." The industry loses $177 billion annually to coordination failures and rework. Not because people aren't working hard — because the tools don't talk to each other.

We work with contractors like [Company Name] to deploy AI agents that sit on top of your existing systems and handle the coordination automatically. Safety monitoring, schedule conflict detection, document processing, compliance tracking — running 24/7 without adding headcount.

One contractor saw a 25% reduction in recordable incidents and 60% faster RFI turnaround within 30 days.

Would it make sense for our CEO Christina Beckford to walk you through how this works for a firm your size? Here's her calendar: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
AfrexAI Team

## Email 2: The Safety Angle (Day 5)

**Subject:** OSHA doesn't care that you're short-staffed

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

650,000 unfilled construction positions in the US. Safety teams stretched thin. And regulators now expect predictive safety insights — not just incident reports after someone gets hurt.

That gap between what OSHA expects and what your team can realistically monitor is where AI agents make the biggest difference. They process incident reports, near-miss data, weather conditions, and subcontractor safety records continuously. They flag risks before they become recordable incidents.

One safety director told us: "We went from reactive to predictive overnight. My team focuses on the high-risk situations instead of drowning in paperwork."

We deploy these agents in 3 weeks, running on your existing data. No new platforms to learn. No IT overhaul.

Worth a 20-minute conversation? Christina's calendar: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
AfrexAI Team

## Email 3: The Competitive Window (Day 10)

**Subject:** Your competitors are already deploying AI agents

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Construction AI spending is projected to hit $6 billion by 2034. That sounds far off — but the contractors gaining the edge are deploying now, not in 2034.

CEMEX Ventures put it bluntly: "In 2025, capital rewarded AI integration. In 2026, capital will reward data defensibility." The firms building their AI infrastructure today will have a structural advantage in bidding, safety records, and operational margins within 12 months.

We help mid-market contractors close that gap without building an internal AI team. Four managed agents — safety, scheduling, compliance, documents — deployed in 3 weeks on your existing tech stack.

$1,500/month for a single agent. $5,000/month for the full workforce. First month at $750 to prove the value.

If this makes sense for [Company Name], I'd love to connect you with our CEO Christina: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
AfrexAI Team
