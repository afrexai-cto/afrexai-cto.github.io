# Partnership Outreach Templates — Boutique Consulting Firms
*Created: 2026-02-19 23:56 GMT | For Christina to deploy*

## Why Partners First
- 40% close rate vs 15% cold outreach
- Near-zero CAC (15% rev share for 12 months)
- 1 active partner = $120K+ ARR annually
- Target: 5 partners by Q2 2026

## Target Partner Profile
- Boutique management/strategy consultants (10-50 people)
- Serve mid-market ($50M-$5B revenue) in finserv, legal, or healthcare
- Already advising on "digital transformation" but CAN'T build AI themselves
- Frustrated by Big 4 taking their clients for tech implementation

## Email 1: The Intro (To Managing Partner / Practice Lead)

**Subject:** Quick question about your AI implementation referrals

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Firm]'s work in [vertical] — particularly [specific thing they published or did].

Quick question: when your clients ask about AI implementation (and I'm guessing they do more every month), what do you tell them?

We're AfrexAI. We build and manage AI agent workforces for mid-market firms — think managed AI operations, not another platform demo. Our clients typically see 3-5x ROI within 90 days.

We're building a referral partner program specifically for boutique consultancies like yours. The pitch is simple:

- You keep the strategy relationship
- We handle AI implementation (your clients' #1 gap)
- You earn 15% of contract value for 12 months
- Average deal: $200K-$400K (so $30K-$60K per referral, recurring)

Would a 15-minute call make sense to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: The Follow-Up (Day 5)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your AI implementation referrals

Hi [Name],

Just circling back. One thing I didn't mention — we handle the hard part.

Most boutique firms lose clients to Deloitte/Accenture the moment "AI implementation" comes up. We exist specifically so that doesn't happen. You stay in the driver's seat. We're your implementation arm.

Current partners are seeing $30K-$60K per referral in passive revenue. Happy to share specifics.

Worth a quick chat?

## Email 3: The Breakup (Day 12)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short — if the timing isn't right for a referral partnership, no worries at all.

But if your clients are asking about AI and you're sending them to the Big 4, you're losing them permanently. We built AfrexAI so firms like yours don't have to.

Our AI Revenue Leak Calculator might be useful either way: [link]

All the best,
Christina
