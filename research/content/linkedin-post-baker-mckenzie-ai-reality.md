# LinkedIn Post — Baker McKenzie Cuts 1,000 Staff: The AI Reality Check

**Hook: Contrarian take on biggest legal AI news of the month**

Baker McKenzie just cut up to 1,000 support staff. Explicitly citing AI.

This isn't a rumor. It's the world's largest law firm by headcount saying out loud what every managing partner is thinking quietly.

But here's what most people are getting wrong about this story:

The disruption isn't AI replacing lawyers. It's AI making the TRUE cost of legal work transparent.

When a brief that used to take 40 hours now takes 10, the billable hour model doesn't just get squeezed — it gets exposed.

In-house teams are already using AI to benchmark what legal work SHOULD cost. Above the Law reported last week that this "transparency crisis" is forcing firms to rethink everything.

The firms that will thrive aren't the ones cutting headcount. They're the ones using AI to deliver MORE value — faster compliance reviews, better risk analysis, proactive regulatory monitoring — at prices that reflect the new reality.

The question isn't whether your firm will adopt AI. It's whether you'll be the one implementing it, or the one getting disrupted by it.

We help legal teams go from AI experiments to working AI agents in 7 days. Not chatbots. Not "copilots." Actual autonomous agents handling compliance, contract review, and regulatory monitoring.

DM me if your firm is past the experimentation phase.
