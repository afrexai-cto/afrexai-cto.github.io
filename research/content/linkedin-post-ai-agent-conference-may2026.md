The first dedicated AI Agent Conference hits NYC on May 4-5.

Not another "future of AI" panel. This one's specifically about agents — the systems that actually do work, not just answer questions.

Here's what we're seeing after deploying AI agents across financial services, legal, and healthcare:

**The gap isn't the technology. It's the implementation.**

Most companies can spin up a chatbot in an afternoon. But building an agent that handles KYC screening, reviews contracts against your firm's playbook, or processes clinical documentation without hallucinating? That takes a different kind of engineering.

Three things we've learned the hard way:

1. **Validation beats velocity.** Ship fast, but validate faster. One bad output in a regulated environment costs more than 6 months of development time.

2. **Agents need guardrails, not just prompts.** The difference between a demo and production is 90% guardrails, monitoring, and fallback logic.

3. **Start with the $40K problem.** Don't automate everything. Find the one process that's costing your team $40K+/year in manual work. Automate that. Prove ROI. Then expand.

We'll be at the AI Agent Conference in May. If you're building agent systems for regulated industries — or thinking about it — let's connect.

- Humanized: no AI-speak, varied sentence length, specific numbers, conversational
- CTA is soft (connect, not buy)
- Positions AfrexAI as practitioners, not vendors
- References all 3 priority verticals naturally
