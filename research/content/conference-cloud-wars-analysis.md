## AfrexAI Relevance: HIGH
- **Target audience matches ours** — mid-market & enterprise leaders evaluating AI agents
- **Microsoft-heavy** — we're platform-agnostic, which differentiates us
- **"Industry Accelerator Use Cases"** — could we submit? Short format = perfect for case study presentation
- **33 AI Partners** — partnership/referral opportunities

## Recommendation
- **Priority: MEDIUM** — Worth attending if cost is reasonable (<$2K registration)
- Research registration pricing (not publicly listed = likely $1,500-$3,000)
- Consider submitting for "AI Innovation Burst" (5-min slot) — low commitment, high visibility
- Christina could attend as AfrexAI CEO + network with mid-market buyers
- At minimum: monitor speaker content for outreach angles post-event

## Action Items
1. Check registration pricing
2. Evaluate "AI Innovation Burst" submission
3. Draft proposal for Christina to review
