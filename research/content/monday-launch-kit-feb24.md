## NEW INTEL THIS WEEK (Use in conversations)

**McKinsey vs EY AI Agent War (Feb 13-17):**
- McKinsey claims 25,000 AI agents deployed in <2 years
- EY's global engineering chief Steve Newman: "The best value comes from just a handful of agents doing heavy lifting"
- PwC's chief AI officer Dan Priest: quantity of agents is "probably the wrong measure"
- **OUR ANGLE:** "McKinsey deployed 25,000 agents. EY says only a handful matter. The truth? It's not about how many agents you have — it's about whether they actually work. That's what we do."

## EMAIL 1: Healthcare — New CIO/CDIO Cold Outreach
**Send to:** Teresa Tonthat (Cook Children's), Anika Gardenhire (Michigan Medicine), Steve LeBlond (Prisma Health), Aaron Wootton (Stormont Vail), Mac Marlow (Bayhealth)
**From:** ksmolichki@afrexai.com
**Subject:** Congratulations on the new role — quick thought on April 3

Hi [First Name],

Congratulations on the [CDIO/CIO] appointment at [Org]. Exciting time.

Quick context: the HHS AI governance mandate hits April 3. Every division needs documented bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, and human oversight frameworks. Most health systems we talk to are starting from scratch.

We've been helping health systems build AI governance and deploy clinical automation agents. Not pilots — production systems. 320 healthcare investors surveyed at VIVE and JP Morgan Healthcare last week said "production-or-bust" is the new standard.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough of what compliant AI governance looks like in practice be useful? Happy to share the framework we use — no pitch, just practical.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## EMAIL 2: Legal — Managing Partner ROI Angle
**Send to:** Managing partners at Am Law 100-200 firms (see prospects/inhouse-legal-targets-feb19.md)
**From:** ksmolichki@afrexai.com
**Subject:** 16 hours to 4 minutes — what contract review looks like now

Hi [First Name],

A firm similar to yours cut complaint response time from 16 hours to 4 minutes last quarter. Another reduced contract drafting from 3 hours to 30 minutes.

These aren't hypothetical. They're happening now across Am Law firms that moved past the "should we use AI?" question.

Even Skadden's former chairman Eric Friedman wrote last week that "AI and leadership choices will define law firm profitability in 2026."

We help firms like [Firm Name] implement AI agents that handle the repetitive work — contract review, due diligence, compliance monitoring — so your associates can focus on the work that actually requires judgment.

Quick question: is AI implementation on your 2026 strategic agenda? If so, I'd love to share what's working for firms in your space.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## EMAIL 3: Community Banking — New Vertical (FRESH)
**Send to:** CIOs/CTOs at community banks $500M-$5B (see prospects/finserv-contacts.md)
**From:** ksmolichki@afrexai.com
**Subject:** Your core provider won't solve this for you

Hi [First Name],

The ABA's latest survey shows community banks rating their core service providers 3.19 out of 5 on innovation. Meanwhile, the OCC just issued an RFI flagging "opaque AI" and data access barriers at CSPs.

Translation: your core provider isn't going to be the one who helps you implement AI. And with 70% of community banks locked into just 3 CSPs, most are waiting for a solution that isn't coming.

We help community banks deploy AI agents for compliance automation, customer service, and back-office operations — independent of your core platform. No lock-in, transparent, regulator-ready.

Would a quick call to discuss what other $[X]B banks are doing with AI make sense?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## EMAIL 4: Financial Services — CFO/COO ROI Measurement
**Send to:** CFOs/COOs at mid-market financial firms (see prospects/finserv-contacts.md)
**From:** ksmolichki@afrexai.com
**Subject:** McKinsey has 25,000 AI agents. Do they know if they work?

Hi [First Name],

McKinsey deployed 25,000 AI agents in under two years. When asked about value, even their competitors at EY and PwC admitted: counting agents is "probably the wrong measure."

The real question isn't how many agents you have. It's whether they deliver measurable ROI.

That's the gap we fill at AfrexAI. We build AI agents with ROI measurement baked in from day one — not as an afterthought. Every agent we deploy comes with KPIs, cost tracking, and quarterly impact reporting.

For a firm like [Company], that typically means automating compliance workflows, client onboarding, or reporting — with clear before/after metrics your board can actually evaluate.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## EMAIL 5: Insurance — Compliance Automation
**Send to:** See prospects/insurance-carrier-ai-leaders.md
**From:** ksmolichki@afrexai.com
**Subject:** The compliance automation gap your team is feeling

Hi [First Name],

Every carrier we talk to has the same story: regulatory requirements are compounding faster than headcount can scale. NAIC model bulletins, state-by-state AI disclosure requirements, and now federal AI governance frameworks landing in Q2.

Most compliance teams are still running on manual review processes built for a simpler regulatory environment.

We deploy AI agents that handle compliance monitoring, policy review, and regulatory change tracking — agents that flag issues before they become findings. One carrier we work with reduced compliance review cycles by 60%.

If compliance automation is on your radar for 2026, I'd welcome a quick call to share what's working.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## LINKEDIN POST (Monday AM — post at 8:30 AM EST)

McKinsey deployed 25,000 AI agents in under two years.

EY's response? "The best value comes from a handful of agents doing the heavy lifting."

PwC's chief AI officer? "Counting agents is probably the wrong measure."

Here's what nobody's saying out loud:

78% of enterprises adopted AI in 2024. Only 15% scaled beyond pilots.

The gap isn't technology. It's implementation.

The firms winning aren't the ones with the most agents. They're the ones whose agents actually work in production — governed, measured, and delivering ROI.

That's the difference between an AI experiment and an AI workforce.

If you're evaluating AI implementation for 2026, the question isn't "how many agents?" It's "how many are actually working?"
