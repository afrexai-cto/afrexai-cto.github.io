# Cold Email Draft — Pat Lawicki, CIO, TruStage
*Draft for Gmail (ksmolichki@afrexai.com) — DO NOT SEND without approval*

## Subject: AI that doesn't scare your team

## Body:

Pat,

Read your CIO.com piece on balancing AI innovation with the people side of things. That tension is real — most CIOs I talk to are stuck between "move fast on AI" pressure from the board and "don't break everything" reality on the ground.

We've been working with insurance and financial services firms on a different approach: managed AI agents that handle specific workflows (claims processing, compliance screening, document review) without requiring your team to become AI engineers.

The pitch is simple — we deploy agents that work alongside your existing staff. No displacement, no retraining cliff. They handle the repetitive stuff so your people do the thinking.

Would a 15-minute call make sense? Happy to show you what this looks like in practice for a carrier like TruStage.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
