## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)
**Subject:** Your associates are spending 40% of billable hours on work AI can do

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question — how much of your associates' time goes to document review, contract comparison, and research summarization?

At most firms we talk to, it's 35-45%. That's $2-4M in billable capacity locked up in work that AI agents handle in minutes.

We built autonomous AI agents for firms like yours — not chatbots, not search tools. Actual agents that draft, review, and flag issues across contracts, discovery docs, and compliance filings.

One mid-market firm cut contract review time by 73% in the first 90 days. Their associates now spend that time on work clients actually value.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits {{firm_name}}?

Best,

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: Your associates are spending 40% of billable hours on work AI can do

{{first_name}} — quick follow-up with something concrete.

We put together a breakdown of how AI agents handle the three biggest time sinks at firms your size:

1. **Contract review** — agents read, compare, and flag deviations against your playbook. 200-page agreements in under 4 minutes.
2. **Due diligence** — structured extraction across thousands of documents. What takes a team 2 weeks, agents do in hours.
3. **Compliance monitoring** — continuous scanning against regulatory changes. No more scrambling when rules shift.

The key difference: these aren't tools your lawyers learn to use. They're agents that do the work and surface what matters.

Happy to walk through a live demo on a real contract. Takes 15 minutes.

## Email 3: The Deadline (Day 7)
**Subject:** Last note — HHS AI governance deadline is April 3

{{first_name}} — final thought.

If {{firm_name}} advises healthcare clients, you'll want to know: the HHS mandate requiring AI governance frameworks across all divisions hits April 3, 2026.

Firms that can offer AI governance advisory NOW will win those engagements. We're helping firms build that capability with managed AI agents that handle compliance monitoring, bias detection, and audit trails.

Two birds: modernize your own operations AND create a new practice area for clients navigating AI regulation.

If the timing's off, no worries. But if it's relevant, 15 minutes could save you from playing catch-up.
