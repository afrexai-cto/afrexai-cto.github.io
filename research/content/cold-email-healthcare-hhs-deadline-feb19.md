### Body (<120 words)

Hi {{first_name}},

The HHS mandate hits April 3 — every division needs documented AI governance practices covering bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, and human oversight.

Most health systems I'm talking to are scrambling. Not because they don't care, but because building compliant AI governance while also deploying useful AI is genuinely hard.

We've built AI agent systems for regulated industries that bake governance in from day one — audit trails, bias checks, human-in-the-loop, the works. Not a framework doc. Working systems.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough of how we handle HHS compliance be useful before the deadline?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

### Day 5 Follow-up

Subject: Re: {{original_subject}}

{{first_name}} — quick follow-up.

Daffodil Health just raised $16.3M to tackle healthcare admin waste with AI. Investors are pouring money into this space because the $1 trillion problem is real.

The orgs that win aren't the ones with the best AI models. They're the ones that deploy fast AND stay compliant.

We help with both. Happy to share how in 15 minutes.

Christina

### Day 12 Breakup

Subject: closing the loop

{{first_name}} — I'll keep this short.

If AI governance and the April 3 deadline aren't a priority right now, totally understand. But if they are and your team just hasn't had bandwidth, we can get you compliant in weeks, not months.

Last nudge from me. Reply anytime if the timing shifts.

Christina
