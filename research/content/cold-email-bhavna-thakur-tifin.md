**Subject:** AI governance for AI-native companies — different beast

**To:** Bhavna Thakur, COO, TIFIN.AI

Hi Bhavna,

TIFIN builds AI products for wealth management. Which means you're in an interesting spot — your clients' regulators (SEC, FINRA) are now scrutinizing the AI tools *they* buy from companies like yours.

Most compliance frameworks were designed for companies *using* AI. Not companies *selling* it. The governance requirements are fundamentally different when your product IS the AI.

We've been working with financial services firms on AI governance — specifically deploying agents that handle model monitoring, bias detection, and audit trail generation. For an AI-native company like TIFIN, the angle isn't just internal compliance. It's making your products more sellable to compliance-conscious buyers.

Would it be worth a 20-minute conversation about what we're seeing in wealthtech AI governance?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
