## Email 1: The Shift (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your chatbot isn't the strategy anymore

Hey {{first_name}},

68% of national banks now rank AI/ML as a top-5 spending priority. But here's the part most are getting wrong — they're still treating it like 2024. Chatbots. Copilots. Fancy search.

The banks pulling ahead (BofA just bumped tech spend 10% to $14B+) are deploying agentic systems — AI that autonomously routes payments, flags fraud patterns, and handles compliance workflows without a human in the loop.

Meanwhile, 42% of US financial firms plan to accelerate AI investments by 50%+ this year. The gap between "experimenting" and "deploying" is where money gets wasted.

We build autonomous AI systems for financial services firms. Not chatbots — agents that actually do the work. Payment routing, compliance monitoring, document processing. The stuff that currently takes your ops team 40+ hours a week.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

## Email 2: The Compliance Angle (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Your chatbot isn't the strategy anymore

Quick follow-up — one thing I didn't mention.

Colorado's SB 24-205 is now in effect. If you're using AI in any lending, insurance, or financial decisions, you need documentation, impact assessments, and governance frameworks. Enforcement starts June 30.

Most firms we talk to don't have this covered. The ones that do built it into their AI systems from day one — automated audit trails, decision explainability, bias monitoring.

That's exactly what our implementation includes. Not bolted on after the fact.

Happy to share how we've structured this for other financial services clients.

## Email 3: The Number (Day 7)

**Subject:** $2.4M

That's what a mid-market bank saved in the first year after deploying autonomous compliance monitoring.

Manual review → AI-flagged exceptions only. 80% reduction in false positives. Audit-ready documentation generated automatically.

I know the inbox is brutal, so I'll keep it short: if reducing compliance costs by 40-60% while improving accuracy sounds interesting, I'd love 15 minutes.

If not, no hard feelings — happy to just share the case study.

## Personalization Notes

### For banks ($1B-$10B assets):
- Lead with regulatory pressure (OCC, state laws)
- Emphasize risk reduction over cost savings
- Reference their specific state regulations if applicable

### For fintechs (Series B-D):
- Lead with speed/efficiency
- Emphasize scaling without proportional headcount
- Reference their funding round if recent ("now that you've raised...")

### For credit unions:
- Lead with member experience
- Emphasize doing more with less (they always have budget constraints)
- Reference NCUA compliance requirements

## Target list for this sequence:
1. Michigan First Credit Union — Cris Mattoon (CCO)
2. Enova International — find CCO
3. Pie Insurance — find VP Compliance
4. TIFIN — find Head of Compliance
5. Inspira Financial — find CRO
