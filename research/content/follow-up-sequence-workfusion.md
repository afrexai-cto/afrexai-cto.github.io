## Day 3 — The "Quick Data Point" Follow-Up

**Subject:** RE: WorkFusion just got acquired. What's your Plan B?

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick data point — after the Kofax/Tungsten acquisition in 2022, mid-market customers saw 15-30% price increases within 18 months once migration pressure kicked in.

UiPath's average contract value is 3x WorkFusion's. Their sales team has targets to hit.

If you want to see what a purpose-built alternative looks like before renewal season, happy to show you in 15 minutes.

## Day 7 — The "Peer Proof" Follow-Up

**Subject:** How other compliance teams are handling the WorkFusion transition

Hi {{first_name}},

Been talking to a few compliance teams this week about the WorkFusion situation. The common concern: "We're fine for now, but what happens in 12 months?"

Smart teams are doing two things:
1. Documenting their current workflows before the platform changes
2. Running a parallel evaluation so they have options before renewal

We've been helping teams do exactly that — no commitment, just clarity on what's possible with purpose-built AI agents vs enterprise platforms.

Want me to send over a comparison framework? Takes 2 minutes to read.

## Day 14 — The "Break-Up" Email

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple of times about alternatives to WorkFusion post-acquisition. Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing the timing isn't right.

Totally fine — I'll close your file for now.

If things change (especially around renewal time), here's what we do in 60 seconds: purpose-built AI agents for KYC, AML, and regulatory reporting. 70% cheaper than enterprise platforms. Working demo in 7 days.

My door's open whenever.
