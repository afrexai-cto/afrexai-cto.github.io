# LinkedIn Post: The Agentic Enterprise Gap

Deloitte just dropped their 2026 Software Industry Outlook.

The headline nobody's talking about: enterprise software firms are racing to build "agentic enterprise" platforms. AI-native companies are partnering with cloud providers for enterprise-grade infrastructure.

But here's the gap nobody's filling:

Who actually IMPLEMENTS these agents inside your operations?

Platforms give you tools. Consulting firms give you slide decks. Neither gives you working AI agents running in production on Day 30.

We talked to a mid-market financial services firm last month. They had:
→ 4 AI platform licenses ($380K/year)
→ 2 consulting engagements ($200K spent)
→ 0 agents in production

Zero.

The problem isn't the technology. It's the last mile — getting agents from "demo" to "doing real work."

That's exactly what managed AI agent services solve. You don't need another platform. You need agents that actually work, monitored 24/7, tuned weekly, delivering ROI from Month 1.

The companies winning in 2026 aren't buying more tools. They're buying outcomes.
