## Email 1: The Problem (Day 0)
**Subject:** $177B in waste — and your competitors are already fixing it

Hey [First Name],

Saw [Company] is doing impressive work on [specific project/signal]. Quick question — how much time does your team spend chasing RFIs, change orders, and subcontractor updates across disconnected systems?

The construction industry loses $177B annually to coordination failures. Most of that isn't bad work — it's good people stuck in bad workflows.

We deploy AI agents that sit on top of your existing stack (Procore, BIM360, whatever you're running) and handle the coordination grunt work: RFI routing, change order flagging, compliance doc tracking, daily report generation.

One mid-market GC we work with cut their RFI response time from 12 days to 3. Not by hiring more PMs — by letting AI handle the routing and follow-ups.

Worth a 20-minute call to see if this fits [Company]?

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 5-7)
**Subject:** Re: $177B in waste — and your competitors are already fixing it

[First Name] — quick follow-up.

Three numbers that matter for construction AI:

1. **44.8% CAGR** — AI in construction is growing from $405M to $6B by 2034. Your competitors are already buying.
2. **650K unfilled positions** — you can't hire your way out of coordination problems anymore.
3. **3x faster RFI resolution** — that's what AI routing delivers vs manual tracking.

We're not selling software you need to implement. We deploy and manage AI agents on your behalf — they're running within 7 days, and you pay monthly. If they don't perform, you cancel.

No 18-month implementation. No change management nightmare. Just results.

20 minutes — I'll show you exactly what it looks like for a company like [Company]: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

## Email 3: The Close (Day 12-14)
**Subject:** Last note on AI for [Company]

[First Name] — I'll keep this short.

We're taking on 3 new construction clients this quarter. Each gets a dedicated AI agent deployment customized to their workflow, managed by our team, live within a week.

If [Company] isn't looking at this right now, no worries at all. But if the coordination overhead is eating into your margins (and at your scale, it almost certainly is), this is the fastest way to fix it without adding headcount.

Happy to do a no-commitment walkthrough: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Either way — good luck with [specific project]. Impressive stuff.
