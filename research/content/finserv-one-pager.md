# AI Compliance Agents for Financial Services
### AfrexAI — Your AI Workforce, Managed

## The Problem

Regulatory pressure is accelerating faster than your compliance team can scale.

- **Colorado SB 24-205** requires AI lending decision disclosure — enforcement starts June 30, 2026
- **Basel III.1** implementation demands real-time risk monitoring
- **AML/KYC costs** average $35M/year for mid-market banks — and rising 15% annually
- **70% of fintechs** rate AML/terrorist financing risk as high or rising (EBA 2025)

Your team is buried in manual reviews. Regulators aren't slowing down.
