# Cold Email Draft — Erie Insurance (Partha Srinivasa)

**To:** Partha Srinivasa, EVP & CIO, Erie Insurance  
**From:** ksmolichki@afrexai.com  
**Subject:** Erie's AI stack — one gap most carriers miss

---

Partha,

Your background at Verisk and Zurich means you've seen how data analytics transforms underwriting. But here's what I keep hearing from CIOs who've deployed AI across claims and pricing: nobody's governing the agents themselves.

Erie has 30+ years of tech discipline (Andy Abramczyk's promotion to SVP CTO signals that). But as autonomous agents start making decisions — routing claims, adjusting reserves, flagging fraud — regulators are catching up fast. Colorado's SB 21-169 is already enforcing algorithmic fairness audits. Connecticut's SB-2 is next.

We built an AI governance framework specifically for P&C carriers that maps agent decisions to regulatory requirements — before the audit letter arrives. It's the layer between your AI investments and your compliance obligations.

Would a 20-minute walkthrough be useful? Happy to show how it maps to Erie's specific regulatory exposure across your 12-state footprint.

Best,

**Target:** Partha Srinivasa, EVP & CIO  
**Company:** Erie Insurance Group (~$9B assets, 12-state P&C carrier)  
**Angle:** His Verisk/CDO background = data-native, but governance gap remains  
**Potential ACV:** $500K-$1M (large carrier, multi-state compliance)  
**Research notes:** Andy Abramczyk is SVP CTO (30yr tenure) — potential technical champion. Srinivasa joined 2022 from Verisk where he was SVP/CDO.
