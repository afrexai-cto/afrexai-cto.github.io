## Context
- HHS mandate: all divisions must adopt AI governance practices by April 3, 2026
- 80% of healthcare execs expect agentic AI to deliver value in 2026 (Deloitte)
- Health systems moving from experimentation to disciplined, scalable AI (Becker's)
- ONC requiring certified systems to prove safe AI integration by 2026 (blueBriX)

## Email 1: The Deadline (Day 0)

**Subject:** April 3 is 46 days away

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

The HHS AI governance mandate hits April 3. Every division in your system needs documented AI governance practices — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security protocols, human oversight.

Most health systems I talk to have some of the pieces but not a unified framework. And 46 days isn't a lot of runway.

We help health systems stand up AI governance and working AI agents in parallel — so you're not just compliant, you're actually getting value from AI by Q2.

Worth a 20-minute call this week to see if we can help?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: April 3 is 46 days away

**Body:**

{{first_name}} — quick follow-up.

Two data points that might matter:

1. Deloitte's 2026 healthcare survey: 80% of health system executives expect agentic AI to deliver moderate-to-significant value this year. The question isn't whether to adopt — it's whether you can implement fast enough.

2. The systems winning right now aren't building AI teams from scratch. They're partnering with implementation specialists who've already solved the governance + deployment puzzle.

We've built AI agent deployments for organizations handling sensitive data at scale — compliance-first, not bolted on after.

Happy to share what a 6-week implementation roadmap looks like for a system like {{company}}.

## Email 3: The Cost of Waiting (Day 9)

**Subject:** What April 4 looks like without a plan

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

Last note on this.

After April 3, non-compliant divisions face audit risk. But honestly, the bigger cost is opportunity cost — every month without working AI agents is $200K-$500K in admin overhead that didn't need to happen.

Clinical documentation alone: most systems report 40-60% time reduction with AI agents handling the first pass.

If this isn't the right time, no worries at all. But if you're feeling the deadline pressure, I can have a framework assessment to you within 48 hours of a call.
