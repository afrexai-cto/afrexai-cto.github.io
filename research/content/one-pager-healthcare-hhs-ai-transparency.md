# AI Transparency for Healthcare — One-Pager

## AfrexAI | Healthcare AI Governance & Compliance

---

### The Problem

**HHS mandates all divisions adopt AI governance practices by April 3, 2026.**

Every healthcare organization using AI for clinical decisions, claims processing, or patient engagement must demonstrate:
- Bias mitigation protocols
- Outcome monitoring systems
- Security & privacy safeguards
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Full transparency documentation

**Miss the deadline → audit risk, reimbursement complications, and reputational damage.**

---

### Who's Affected

| AI Use Case | Risk Level | Urgency |
|---|---|---|
| Clinical decision support (CDSS) | Critical | Immediate |
| Claims processing & coding | High | Q1 2026 |
| Patient scheduling & triage | Medium | Q2 2026 |
| Revenue cycle management | Medium | Q2 2026 |
| Administrative automation | Low | Q3 2026 |

If you use Epic, Cerner, or any AI-assisted clinical tools — you're in scope.
