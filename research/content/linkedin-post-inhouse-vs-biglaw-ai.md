# LinkedIn Post — In-House Legal Teams Are About to Change Everything

**Hook: In-house vs Biglaw power shift**

Your in-house legal team just got a superpower. And your outside counsel should be nervous.

Here's what's happening right now:

Sophisticated in-house teams are using purpose-built AI to benchmark legal work. Contract review that used to take 40 hours? They can see it takes 3 with the right tools.

That $100K flat fee for a deal? When your GC knows the AI-assisted cost is closer to $8K in actual work — that conversation gets uncomfortable fast.

This isn't theoretical. Above the Law just ran a piece on it. The billable hour model isn't dying because of technology. It's dying because AI made the real cost of legal work *transparent*.

So what does this mean for in-house teams?

Two paths:

1. Keep outsourcing everything and hope your firms don't overcharge
2. Deploy AI agents internally — contract review, compliance monitoring, regulatory tracking — and only send out what genuinely needs outside counsel

The teams choosing path 2 are cutting outside legal spend by 40-60%.

Not by replacing lawyers. By replacing the work that shouldn't have needed a lawyer in the first place.

We're building those AI agents for legal teams right now.

DM if your legal department is ready to stop subsidizing someone else's associate training program.
