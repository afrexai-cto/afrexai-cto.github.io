# LinkedIn Post — AI Disruption in Financial Services (Feb 16, 2026)

Investors just punished Charles Schwab, Raymond James, and Ameriprise stocks because a startup automated tax planning with AI.

But here's what everyone's missing:

Robo-advisors had 10+ years and only hit 2-4% penetration. AI agents won't replace financial advisors either.

What they WILL do is make the back office disappear.

→ Compliance screening that took 3 hours? 11 minutes.
→ Client onboarding docs? Auto-generated.
→ KYC/AML reviews? Running 24/7.

The firms that survive aren't the ones fighting AI. They're the ones deploying it where humans shouldn't be spending time anyway.

Goldman Sachs is already running AI agents for accounting and compliance. McKinsey deployed 25,000 agents in under 2 years.

The question isn't "will AI disrupt financial services?"

It's "who's implementing it properly vs. who's just buying software and hoping?"

(Hint: 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027 — Gartner)

That's where implementation partners come in.
