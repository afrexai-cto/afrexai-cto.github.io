## Email 1 — Warm Intro (Day 1)

**Subject:** Congrats on the Corewell Health role

Hi Cindy,

Saw the Becker's piece on your appointment as SVP and Chief Compliance & Privacy Officer at Corewell Health — congratulations.

Stepping into compliance at a system that merged Spectrum Health and Beaumont is no small thing. Two legacy compliance frameworks, different EHR workflows, and the HHS AI governance deadline hitting April 3.

We work with health systems on exactly this problem — AI agents that automate compliance monitoring, bias audits, and privacy controls across merged entities. One system got fully compliant in 3 weeks instead of 6 months.

Not sure if it's relevant to where Corewell is right now, but happy to share how they did it — no pitch, just the playbook.

Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — Value Add (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Congrats on the Corewell Health role

Hi Cindy,

Quick follow-up — I put together a one-page checklist of the 7 things health systems are doing to hit the April 3 HHS AI governance deadline.

[Link to AI Governance Readiness Checklist]

Two items that tend to surprise new CCOs at merged systems: (1) each legacy entity likely has different AI tools that need separate bias audits, and (2) the privacy controls from Spectrum and Beaumont probably don't map 1:1.

Happy to walk through how other systems have handled the merger-specific compliance gaps if useful.

## Email 3 — Social Proof (Day 10)

**Subject:** How a $9B health system got HHS-compliant in 3 weeks

Hi Cindy,

Last one from me — wanted to share a quick case study.

A health system similar in size to Corewell was 8 weeks from the HHS deadline with no AI governance framework in place. They were planning a 6-month manual buildout.

We deployed AI compliance agents that:
- Mapped all existing AI tools across departments in 48 hours
- Ran automated bias audits on clinical decision support systems
- Generated the required documentation and monitoring dashboards
- Set up continuous compliance monitoring (not just a one-time audit)

They were fully compliant in 3 weeks. The CFO estimated it saved $400K in consultant fees.

If Corewell is thinking about the April deadline, I'd love 15 minutes to show you the playbook.

Christina
