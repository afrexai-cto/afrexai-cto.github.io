## Email 1: The Hook

**Subject:** SB-205 and Pie's AI underwriting — quick question

Holly,

Pie's expansion into 50 states is impressive — 55,000+ policies and growing. But with Colorado's SB-205 hitting enforcement this year, every AI-driven underwriting decision Pie makes is now a "consequential decision" under the law.

That means algorithmic impact assessments, consumer notification requirements, and audit trails for your pricing models. Most insurtechs we talk to have maybe 30% of this in place.

We built an AI governance framework specifically for insurance carriers that maps directly to SB-205's requirements. Takes about 6 weeks to implement, and it actually speeds up your underwriting — not slows it down.

Worth a 20-minute call to see if there's a gap?

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Email 2: The Value Drop (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: SB-205 and Pie's AI underwriting

Holly,

Forgot to mention — we put together a 50-point SB-205 Compliance Readiness Assessment that scores where insurance carriers stand across inventory, impact assessments, consumer notification, governance, and audit trails.

Happy to send it over. Most carriers score between 35-55% on first pass. The ones who get ahead of enforcement avoid the scramble later.

## Email 3: The Breakup (Day 9)

**Subject:** Re: SB-205 and Pie's AI underwriting

Holly,

I know compliance leaders have 47 things competing for attention right now. If SB-205 isn't on the priority list yet, no worries.

But if Pie's board starts asking about AI governance readiness (and they will — every carrier board is), here's our direct line: christina@afrexai.com

We'll be here when the timing's right.

Christina
