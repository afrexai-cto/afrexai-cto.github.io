# LinkedIn Post — The "New CIO" Pattern
*Drafted: 2026-02-18 | Target: CIOs/CTOs in first 6 months of role*

---

Something I keep seeing in 2026:

New CIOs getting hired with an explicit "AI mandate." Adobe, Delta, NCR Atleos, BioMarin — all appointed tech leaders in the last 30 days. Every single one has "AI transformation" somewhere in their brief.

Here's the problem.

Your board expects AI results by your first review. But building an internal AI team takes 6-9 months. Hiring ML engineers in this market? Good luck. And the compliance landscape (HHS mandate, SEC disclosure rules, state AI laws) changes faster than you can write policy.

The CIOs who are winning right now aren't building from scratch. They're deploying managed AI agents — production-ready, compliant, running in weeks.

One healthcare system went from zero AI to fully governed agents across clinical documentation in 3 weeks. Not a pilot. Not a POC. Production.

If you're a new CIO with an AI mandate and a ticking clock — that's the move.
