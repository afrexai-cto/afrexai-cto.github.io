# AI Agents for Law Firms — One-Pager

## The Problem

Your attorneys are drowning in repetitive work that AI could handle — but "AI" so far means chatbots that still need a human babysitting every output. Meanwhile, Am Law 50 firms are deploying autonomous AI agents that review contracts, monitor regulatory changes, and draft memos while your associates sleep.

**The gap is widening fast:**
- Top 20 firms report 30-40% faster due diligence with AI agents
- Clients increasingly demand AI-assisted pricing (lower fees, faster turnaround)
- Associates spending 60%+ of billable time on work AI agents handle better

## What We Deploy

### Contract Review & Analysis Agent

- Flags non-standard terms, missing clauses, risk exposure

- Maps changes to your client portfolios automatically
- Generates client alerts with plain-English impact summaries
- Never misses a Federal Register update again

### Due Diligence Agent

- Builds structured issue lists ranked by materiality
- Reduces associate hours on standard DD by 60-70%
- Frees your team for judgment-intensive analysis

### Knowledge Management Agent

## Why AfrexAI vs. DIY or Big Vendors

| | DIY (GPT/Claude) | Legal AI Vendors | AfrexAI |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Setup time** | Months of prompt engineering | 6-12 month implementation | 3 weeks to first agent live |
| **Customization** | You build everything | Their workflow, your data | Your workflow, your rules |
| **Autonomy** | Human reviews every output | Semi-automated | Fully autonomous with escalation |
| **Cost** | Hidden eng costs, $200K+/yr | $500K-$1M/yr platform fees | $150K-$400K/yr, outcome-tied |
| **Data control** | Full (but you maintain it) | Their cloud, their terms | Your infrastructure, your data |

## Pricing

- **Single Agent Deployment:** $150K-$250K/year
- **Multi-Agent Suite (3+):** $300K-$400K/year
- **Pilot Program:** 3-week proof of concept, one workflow, fixed $25K

All pricing includes setup, training, monitoring, and quarterly optimization.

## The Math

**A 200-attorney firm spending $15M/yr on associate salaries:**
- 30% of associate work is AI-automatable = $4.5M in recoverable capacity
- AfrexAI deployment at $300K/yr = 15:1 ROI
- Or: redeploy those hours to higher-value work and increase revenue per attorney

**For Am Law 101-200 firms:** This is how you compete with firms 3x your size.
