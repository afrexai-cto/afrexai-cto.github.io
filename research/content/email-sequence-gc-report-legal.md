# Email Sequence: General Counsel Under Pressure (3-Part)
*Target: GCs and CLOs at mid-market firms (500-5,000 employees)*
*Trigger: FTI/Relativity General Counsel Report Feb 2026*

## Email 1 — Day 0: "87% of GCs say it's getting worse"
**Subject:** The number your board hasn't seen yet
**From:** Christina Beckford, AfrexAI

Hi [First Name],

The FTI/Relativity General Counsel Report came out this week. One number stood out:

87% of GCs say the rate of risk and demand is accelerating within their organization.

Not "staying the same." Accelerating.

Meanwhile, 60% say operations got more complicated this year, and a third say their environment is more unpredictable than ever.

I'm curious — is your legal team keeping pace, or are you seeing the same squeeze?

We work with legal departments to deploy AI agents that handle the volume work: contract review, regulatory monitoring, compliance tracking. Not replacing your team — giving them capacity back.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense?

Best,
Christina

## Email 2 — Day 5: "How one firm got 40 hours back per week"
**Subject:** Re: The number your board hasn't seen yet

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on my note about the GC Report findings.

One pattern we see with legal teams: the bottleneck isn't complexity — it's volume. Your best lawyers are spending 30-40% of their time on work that's important but repetitive.

Contract review queues. Regulatory change monitoring. Due diligence document sorting.

We built AI agents that handle these workflows end-to-end. One firm recovered 40+ hours per week across their team in the first 90 days.

The agents don't replace judgment calls. They handle the throughput so your team can focus on the judgment calls.

If that sounds relevant, I'd love to show you a quick demo. Takes 15 minutes.

## Email 3 — Day 12: "Last thought on legal AI"
**Subject:** One question before I close the loop

Hi [First Name],

Last note from me on this.

The General Counsel Report highlighted something I think matters: GCs who are investing in technology aren't doing it to cut costs. They're doing it because the alternative — more headcount for exponentially growing work — doesn't scale.

One question worth asking: if your legal team's workload doubles in 18 months (87% say it will), how are you planning to handle it?

If AI agents aren't part of that answer yet, we should talk. We specialize in building managed AI workforces for legal teams — deployment in weeks, not months.

Here's our compliance readiness assessment if you want to see where you stand: [LINK]

Either way, wishing you a strong Q2.
