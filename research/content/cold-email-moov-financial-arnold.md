# Cold Email — Moov Financial (Wade Arnold, CEO)

## Context
Moov Financial: open-source payments infrastructure. Growing fast, embedded compliance features. Colorado-based — SB 24-205 directly applies. Could be prospect OR partner (they serve fintechs who need AI compliance).

**Subject:** Quick question about Moov's AI governance approach

**To:** Wade Arnold, CEO, Moov Financial

Hi Wade,

Moov's approach to open-source payments infrastructure is sharp — building compliance into the rails rather than bolting it on after the fact.

Quick question: as SB 24-205 enforcement kicks in this month, are your fintech customers asking about AI governance for their lending and underwriting models that run on Moov's infrastructure?

We built a 3-week AI compliance framework that's been deployed in healthcare (HHS deadline was tight). Financial services is the same pattern — document the models, test for bias, build the AG-ready package.

Two angles I think could work:

1. **For Moov directly** — if you're using ML in fraud detection or risk scoring, we can audit and document in 3 weeks flat. Fixed price, no surprise bills.

2. **For Moov's customers** — we could be a compliance partner you refer fintechs to. They get governance sorted fast, you reduce platform risk. Everyone wins.

Either way, happy to do a 15-min call to see if there's a fit.

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Follow-up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about Moov's AI governance approach

Wade — wanted to bump this. With Colorado AG enforcement starting this quarter, fintechs building on Moov are going to face questions about their AI decision documentation.

We put together a one-pager on what SB 24-205 actually requires for payments/lending companies. Happy to share if useful.

## Follow-up (Day 9)

**Subject:** Moov + AI compliance (last note)

Wade — last follow-up. If AI governance isn't on the radar right now, totally get it. But if any of your customers are scrambling with SB 24-205 requirements, we'd be a good referral partner.

Open invitation: christina@afrexai.com whenever it makes sense.

Christina
