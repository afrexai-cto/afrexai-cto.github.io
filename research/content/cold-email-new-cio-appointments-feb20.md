## 1. Teresa Tonthat — Chief Digital & Information Officer, Cook Children's Health Care (Fort Worth, TX)

**Subject:** Quick win for your first 90 days at Cook Children's

Hi Teresa,

Congratulations on the CDIO role at Cook Children's — exciting time to be leading digital transformation in pediatric care.

Quick question: with the HHS AI governance deadline hitting April 3, does your team have a plan for compliance documentation and bias monitoring across your AI tools?

We've helped health systems get from "no framework" to "audit-ready" in under 3 weeks. Happy to share how — no pitch, just the playbook.

Worth a 15-minute call?

CEO, AfrexAI

## 2. Anika Gardenhire — First Chief Digital & Information Officer, Michigan Medicine (Ann Arbor, MI)

**Subject:** Being Michigan Medicine's first CDIO — and the April 3 deadline

Hi Anika,

Being the *first* CDIO at Michigan Medicine is a massive opportunity. You're setting the playbook from scratch.

One thing landing on every new healthcare tech leader's desk right now: the HHS AI governance mandate (April 3). Bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security frameworks, human oversight — all required across divisions.

We build the AI governance infrastructure so health systems can demonstrate compliance fast. For a first-in-role leader, having this solved in your first quarter sends a strong signal.

Happy to share what we've built for similar orgs. 15 minutes?

## 3. Steve LeBlond — Chief Information & Digital Officer, Prisma Health (Greenville, SC)

**Subject:** Prisma Health's AI governance gap — April 3 is 42 days away

Hi Steve,

Welcome to Prisma Health. Big shoes, big system, and a ticking clock: the HHS AI governance deadline is April 3 — 42 days from today.

Every division needs documented AI governance: bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security protocols, human oversight. Most health systems we talk to have maybe 20% of this in place.

We've built a turnkey AI governance framework that gets health systems audit-ready in 3 weeks. For a new CIDO taking over a $5B+ system, having this handled early is a strong first move.

Worth a quick call next week?

CEO, AfrexAI

## 4. Thomas (Mac) Marlow — VP & Chief Digital & Information Officer, Bayhealth (Dover, DE)

**Subject:** Your first 90 days at Bayhealth — one thing to knock out early

Hi Mac,

Congrats on the CDIO role at Bayhealth. Dover's a great system and this is a pivotal time for health IT leadership.

Quick heads up if it's not already on your radar: the HHS AI governance mandate drops April 3. All health system divisions need documented AI governance frameworks — bias monitoring, security, human oversight, the works.

We help new health IT leaders get this done in weeks, not months. It's a quick win that demonstrates leadership early.

15 minutes to see if it's relevant for Bayhealth?

## 5. Aaron Wootton — VP of IT & CIO, Stormont Vail Health (Topeka, KS)

**Subject:** New CIO playbook — the one deadline you can't miss

Hi Aaron,

Congrats on the CIO role at Stormont Vail. Mid-market health systems like yours are where AI implementation actually gets interesting — big enough to matter, small enough to move fast.

One thing to flag: the HHS AI governance deadline (April 3) requires documented frameworks across all divisions. The big academic medical centers are scrambling. Regional systems that get ahead of this stand out.

We build AI governance infrastructure for health systems — 3-week implementation, fully documented, audit-ready. Happy to share what we've seen work.

Worth a call?
