# LinkedIn Post — AI Governance Checklist Launch
*Created: 2026-02-16 | For: AfrexAI company page or Christina's profile*

The HHS AI governance mandate drops April 3rd.

Every healthcare org needs bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security protocols, and human oversight frameworks — in writing — by then.

We built a free AI Governance Readiness Checklist that covers all of it:

✅ Bias testing & fairness audits
✅ Outcome monitoring dashboards
✅ Security & access controls
✅ Human-in-the-loop protocols
✅ Documentation & audit trails

It's the same framework we use when deploying AI agents for healthcare systems.

Grab it here → [afrexai-cto.github.io/ai-governance-checklist](https://afrexai-cto.github.io/ai-governance-checklist/)

47 days left. If you're in healthcare and haven't started, now's the time.
