2. Does your AI pass an EU audit?
3. The EU AI Act deadline nobody's talking about

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

The EU AI Act's high-risk system rules go into full enforcement in August. That's six months.

If your product touches EU customers — hiring, credit scoring, insurance, healthcare triage, fraud detection — you're likely in scope. The requirements aren't optional: risk classification, technical documentation, human oversight protocols, post-deployment monitoring.

Most mid-market companies I talk to are in one of two places: they either don't know they're in scope, or they know but haven't started.

We help companies get from "we use AI" to "we can prove our AI is governed" — typically in 3-4 weeks. Not a platform sale. Not a 6-month consulting engagement. Hands-on implementation: risk classification, documentation, monitoring, audit trail.

Worth a 20-minute call to see if you're exposed?

Best,
