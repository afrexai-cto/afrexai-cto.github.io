## Email 1: The Merger Hook (Day 1)

**Subject:** Pinnacle merger + compliance integration — there's a faster way

**Body:**

Dan,

Merging compliance programs is brutal. Two banks, two sets of KYC/AML workflows, two BSA reporting systems, one deadline.

I saw your comments on building a culture of creativity around compliance tech. That's exactly the mindset that makes AI agents work — not replacing your team, but giving them superpowers during the hardest integration period of their careers.

We deploy AI agents that unify compliance workflows across merging entities. KYC screening, AML monitoring, regulatory reporting — all running in weeks, not the 12-18 months traditional consultants quote.

Would it be useful to see how this works for a bank going through exactly what Synovus is?

## Email 2: The Pain (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Pinnacle merger + compliance integration

**Body:**

Dan,

One stat that haunts compliance teams during bank mergers: the average integration takes 18 months, and regulatory findings increase 40% during the transition.

We've seen AI agents cut that risk dramatically:
- Unified sanctions screening across both legacy systems from day one
- Automated SAR narrative generation (consistent format, audit-ready)
- Real-time gap analysis between two compliance frameworks

The Pinnacle deal is a growth story. Don't let compliance integration become the bottleneck.

Happy to walk through specifics in 15 minutes.

## Email 3: The Close (Day 9)

**Subject:** last thought on the merger integration

**Body:**

Dan,

I know your plate is full with the Pinnacle integration. I'll be brief.

If compliance automation is on your roadmap for 2026, we should talk before you're locked into a 12-month consulting engagement. We deploy in weeks and you keep the IP.

If the timing's off, no problem. But the integration window is when this matters most.
