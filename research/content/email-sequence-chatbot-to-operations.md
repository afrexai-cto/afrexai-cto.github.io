# Email Sequence: "Chatbot Era Is Over" — CTO/CIO Outreach
*Target: CTOs and CIOs at mid-market enterprises ($100M-$5B) still running AI pilots*

## Email 1 — Day 0: The Wake-Up Call

**Subject:** Capital One just killed the chatbot. Your move.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick data point that landed this week:

Capital One embedded multi-agent AI workflows directly into operations. Not a pilot. Not a chatbot. Autonomous agents handling real business processes, under real constraints.

Meanwhile, 78% of enterprises say they've "adopted AI." Only 15% have scaled beyond pilots.

That 63% gap is where money goes to die.

We help regulated mid-market companies close that gap — typically in 90 days, not 18 months.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense to see if there's a fit?

Best,
[Christina Beckford]
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — Day 5: The Cost of Waiting

**Subject:** Re: Capital One just killed the chatbot

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

One thing I didn't mention — NIST just launched their AI Agent Standards Initiative. Federal governance guidelines are coming in months, not years.

Companies that built governance INTO their AI implementations from day one won't need to retrofit. Everyone else is looking at a six-figure remediation bill.

We build compliance in from the start. It's not a bolt-on.

Happy to walk you through what that looks like in [their industry] specifically.

Best,
Christina

## Email 3 — Day 12: Social Proof + Soft Close

**Subject:** How [Industry] firms are closing the AI pilot gap

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Last note on this — we've been working with [industry] firms specifically on moving from AI experiments to production workflows.

The pattern we see:
1. Pilots that "worked" but never scaled (usually governance or integration gaps)
2. Executive frustration with AI ROI ("we spent $500K and got a chatbot")
3. Competitive pressure as peers announce real AI deployments

If any of that sounds familiar, I'd love a quick conversation. No pitch — just comparing notes on what's actually working.

Best,
Christina
