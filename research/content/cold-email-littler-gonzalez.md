## Email 1: The "New Role" Hook

**Subject:** Quick thought on AI at Littler

Carlos —

Congrats on the CDIO role at Littler. Read the Law.com piece about the hire — sounds like you're walking into a firm that actually wants to move on AI, not just talk about it.

Coming from Epiq, you've seen the gap between what legal tech promises and what it delivers. Most "AI for law" is really just search with a chatbot skin.

We build something different — managed AI agents that actually do work. Contract review, compliance screening, document triage. Not a platform you have to figure out. Working agents, tuned to your workflows, managed by us.

Troutman Pepper's team is running 3,000+ AI prompts a day now. Happy to share what's working for firms your size.

Worth a 15-minute call this week?

## Email 2: The Value Drop (Day 4)

**Subject:** re: Quick thought on AI at Littler

Carlos — one more thing.

Employment law firms handle a brutal volume of repetitive filings. EEOC charges, wage/hour compliance, state-by-state regulatory tracking across 50 jurisdictions.

We've mapped out how AI agents handle the intake-to-analysis pipeline for exactly this kind of work. Cuts 60-70% of the grunt hours while improving consistency.

Put together a short framework doc — happy to send it over if useful. No pitch, just the architecture.

## Email 3: The Breakup (Day 9)

**Subject:** re: Quick thought on AI at Littler

Carlos — I'll keep this short.

If AI implementation isn't a priority right now, totally get it. You're probably still mapping the landscape.

But if you want a no-BS conversation about what actually works at scale (and what doesn't), I'm here. We've been in the trenches with firms doing 1,000+ attorney deployments.

Either way — good luck with the new role. Littler's in a strong position if you move fast.

— Christina

## Notes
- Angle: respect his Epiq background (he knows tech), don't oversimplify
- Employment law = unique pain point (50-state compliance, massive doc volume)
- Social proof: Troutman Pepper (3K prompts/day)
- Tone: peer-to-peer, not vendor-to-buyer
- **DO NOT SEND** without Kalin/Christina approval (human-facing outreach)
