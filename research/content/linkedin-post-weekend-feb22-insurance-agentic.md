Insurance giants are deploying AI agents that orchestrate entire claims workflows.

Not chatbots. Not RPA. Actual agents that:

→ Ingest unstructured emails and scanned PDFs
→ Extract coverage and risk information
→ Apply policy rules automatically
→ Route exceptions to human adjusters
→ Trigger payments and customer notifications

Microsoft + Cognizant just announced a joint agentic AI deployment for insurance carriers.

Meanwhile, MIT Sloan published this week that agentic AI's killer app is "performing tasks a human typically would — writing contracts, negotiating terms, determining prices — at much lower marginal cost."

Here's the problem nobody talks about:

These systems touch legacy policy admin, billing, and claims platforms that were NEVER designed for autonomous coordination.

Which means the implementation layer — the firm that makes these agents actually work inside your existing stack — is the bottleneck.

Not the AI. Not the model. The integration.

That's exactly where we sit.

If your carrier is past the "should we use AI?" question and into the "how do we make it work with our 15-year-old policy admin system?" question — that's the conversation worth having.
