# LinkedIn Post — Insurance AI Compliance ROI Calculator

**For:** AfrexAI company page

How much are AI governance gaps actually costing your insurance operation?

Not in theory. In dollars.

We built a calculator that maps it out:
→ Regulatory fine exposure across every state you operate in
→ Market conduct exam costs if one gets triggered
→ Manual compliance labor you're burning
→ Remediation costs if a violation surfaces

Then it shows what changes with automated governance.

Most carriers we talk to are surprised. The number is usually 3-5x what they assumed.

The math is simple: fix it proactively for $120K, or get caught reactively for $500K+.
