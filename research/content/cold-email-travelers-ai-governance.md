# Cold Email Draft — Travelers (Kevin De Sa, SVP & CIO Business Insurance)
*Draft for ksmolichki@afrexai.com — DO NOT SEND without approval*

**To:** Kevin De Sa, SVP & CIO Business Insurance, Travelers
**Subject:** Travelers' Gartner CIO 100 win + CT SB-2 — timing question

---

Kevin,

Travelers winning the 2024 Gartner CIO 100 for your AI and deep learning work was well deserved. Curious how you're thinking about the governance side now that CT SB-2 enforcement kicks in.

With the AG's enforcement authority starting and the 60-day cure window closing June 30, carriers headquartered in CT are uniquely exposed. Your business insurance AI models — pricing, risk selection, claims automation — all fall squarely under the developer/deployer obligations.

We help carriers build AI governance that satisfies regulators without slowing down innovation. The goal isn't compliance paperwork — it's auditable AI that actually performs better because it's transparent.

Given your new role leading BI technology, figured this might be on your radar. Happy to share a 2-page framework we've been using with carriers if useful.

Best,
[AfrexAI signature]

- Kevin is NEW in role (Jan 2025) — wants quick wins
- Specific regulatory deadline creates urgency
- Offers concrete deliverable (2-page framework) vs vague "let's chat"
