Jim,

Read your piece in HealthTech about evaluating AI at Lakewood. The challenge you described — wanting enterprise-grade AI without enterprise-grade budgets — is exactly what we solve.

We deploy managed AI agents for mid-market health systems. Not a platform you have to figure out. Not a 12-month implementation. Working agents in 2-4 weeks that handle:

- Clinical documentation (cutting 2+ hours/day of physician admin)
- Claims denial prevention (recovering $2-5M/year for systems your size)
- HHS AI governance compliance (the April 3 deadline is 7 weeks out)

We're not trying to replace your IT team. We extend it — you get the same AI capabilities as a $5B system, managed end-to-end, starting at $120K/year.

Worth a 15-minute call this week to see if there's a fit?

Best,
AfrexAI Team
