46 days.

That's how long healthcare organizations have before the HHS mandate kicks in — April 3, 2026.

Every division must adopt AI governance practices. Bias mitigation. Outcome monitoring. Security protocols. Human oversight frameworks.

Here's what most health systems are missing:

The mandate doesn't just say "have a policy." It requires demonstrable practices — meaning you need systems that can prove compliance under audit.

80% of health system executives expect agentic AI to deliver real value this year (Deloitte). But without governance infrastructure, that AI becomes a liability, not an asset.

The organizations moving fastest right now aren't buying more AI tools. They're building the governance layer that makes AI defensible.

If your team is still in "we'll figure it out" mode, 46 days goes fast.
