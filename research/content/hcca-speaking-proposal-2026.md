## Session Title
**"3 Weeks to HHS-Compliant AI Governance — A Practical Playbook for Health Systems"**

## Session Format
45-minute breakout session with 15-minute Q&A

## Abstract

The HHS AI governance mandate hit April 3, 2026. Most health systems scrambled. Some didn't make it. This session shares a battle-tested, 3-week implementation framework that takes organizations from zero AI governance to documented, audit-ready compliance.

No theory. No slide decks full of frameworks you'll never use. This is the actual playbook — what worked, what failed, and the shortcuts nobody talks about.

Attendees walk away with:
- A copy of the AI System Inventory template (works in Excel, no vendor lock-in)
- The 3-phase implementation timeline with week-by-week deliverables
- Real numbers: what Big 4 charges ($500K-$1.2M) vs. what it actually costs ($150K-$250K)
- The 5 audit findings CMS is flagging most often in 2026

## Learning Objectives

1. Identify and classify AI systems by HHS risk tier (clinical, administrative, operational)
2. Build an AI governance framework that satisfies HHS, CMS, Joint Commission, and state-level requirements simultaneously
3. Implement bias monitoring and transparency documentation without disrupting clinical workflows
4. Calculate the ROI of proactive AI governance vs. reactive remediation after audit findings

## Why This Matters Now

- Compliant and looking to optimize (10%)
- Partially compliant and nervous (60%)
- Non-compliant and panicking (30%)

This session speaks to all three groups with actionable, vendor-neutral guidance — which happens to be exactly what AfrexAI delivers as a service.
