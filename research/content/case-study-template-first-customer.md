## [COMPANY NAME]: How a [INDUSTRY] Firm Deployed AI Agents in 7 Days

### The Problem
[COMPANY] was spending **[X] hours/week** on [manual process]. Their team of [N] people couldn't keep up with [growing demand / compliance burden / operational complexity]. They'd evaluated [tools/platforms] but found them too rigid, too expensive to customize, or too slow to deploy.

### Why AfrexAI
Unlike platforms that take months to implement, AfrexAI deploys managed AI agents in **under 7 days**. No engineering hire. No integration project. Just outcomes.

**What they got:**
- [Agent 1]: [What it does] — replaced [X] hours/week of manual work
- [Agent 2]: [What it does] — [specific outcome]
- [Agent 3]: [What it does] — [specific outcome]
- Built-in governance: audit trails, human-in-the-loop controls, compliance documentation

### Results (First 30 Days)
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Hours on [task] | [X]/week | [Y]/week | -[Z]% |
| [Error/miss rate] | [X]% | [Y]% | -[Z]% |
| Response time | [X] hours | [Y] minutes | [Z]x faster |
| Monthly cost | $[X] (staff time) | $[Y] (AfrexAI) | [Z]% savings |

### In Their Words
> "[Quote from champion/decision-maker about the experience]"
