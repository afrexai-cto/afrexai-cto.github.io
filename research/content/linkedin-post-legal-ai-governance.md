# LinkedIn Post — Legal AI Governance (Draft for AfrexAI page)

---

**Most law firms are sleepwalking into an AI compliance problem.**

HHS just set an April 3 deadline for AI governance across all divisions — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, human oversight, the works.

But here's what nobody's talking about: if you're a firm advising healthcare clients on AI compliance... your own AI usage needs to be airtight first.

And right now? Most firms are running ChatGPT on the side with zero governance framework.

Three things every managing partner should be asking this week:

1. Do we have an AI acceptable use policy that actually covers generative AI? (Not the one from 2019 about "technology tools.")

2. Can we demonstrate human oversight on every AI-assisted deliverable? Because opposing counsel WILL ask.

3. Are our vendors SOC 2 compliant? If your AI tools can't pass an audit, neither can you.

The firms getting ahead aren't the ones with the fanciest AI tools. They're the ones with governance baked in from day one.

Legalweek starts March 9. If you're going, this should be the #1 topic on your agenda.
