# Cold Emails — New Healthcare CIO Appointments (Feb 20, 2026)

## Email 1: Anika Gardenhire, CDIO — Michigan Medicine

**Subject:** First CDIO at Michigan Medicine — congrats (and a thought)

Hi Anika,

Saw the announcement — first-ever Chief Digital and Information Officer at Michigan Medicine. That's a big mandate.

Building a digital strategy from scratch at an academic medical center is both exciting and overwhelming. Especially with the HHS AI governance deadline hitting April 3 — every health system needs defensible AI practices in place, and you're walking into that on day one.

We help health systems like yours go from "AI pilot" to "AI workforce" — managed agents that handle clinical documentation, claims processing, and compliance monitoring. Not another platform to manage. Actual working systems, fully governed.

Would a 20-minute call be useful? Happy to share what's working at similar-sized systems.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: Steve LeBlond, CIDO — Prisma Health

**Subject:** New at Prisma — quick thought on AI implementation

Hi Steve,

Welcome to Prisma Health. Stepping into a $4B+ system's tech leadership is no small thing — and with Rich Rogers' retirement, there's both opportunity and pressure to make your mark fast.

One thing we're seeing across health systems right now: the HHS AI governance mandate (April 3 deadline) is forcing everyone to get serious about how AI is deployed and monitored. It's not optional anymore.

We run managed AI agents for health systems — clinical documentation, claims, compliance — fully governed and auditable from day one. No 18-month implementation. Working systems in weeks.

Worth a quick conversation? I can share specifics on what's working at systems your size.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 3: Teresa Tonthat, CDIO — Cook Children's Health Care

**Subject:** Digital transformation at Cook Children's — a resource

Hi Teresa,

Congratulations on the CDIO role at Cook Children's. Pediatric health systems have unique challenges — and unique opportunities to lead on innovation.

With the HHS AI governance mandate landing April 3, every health system is scrambling to get compliant. We've been helping systems implement AI agents that are auditable, governed, and actually reduce clinician burden — not add to it.

Our sweet spot: clinical documentation automation, claims processing, and AI governance frameworks. All managed, so your team doesn't need to build from scratch.

Would a brief call be useful? Happy to share what we're seeing work in specialty systems.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
