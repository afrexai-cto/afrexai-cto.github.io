# LinkedIn Post: FinServ AI Compliance

Every week, another financial services firm creates a "Chief AI Officer" role.

Not because AI is trendy. Because regulators are forcing the issue.

Colorado's AI Act (SB 24-205) kicks in June 30. The EU AI Act is already live. The HHS AI governance mandate lands April 3.

And most firms? Still running compliance on spreadsheets and prayer.

Here's what we're seeing with our clients:

→ Manual compliance review: 40+ hours/week per team
→ With AI agents handling triage + flagging: 6 hours/week
→ Same quality. Better audit trails. Zero burnout.

The firms that move now get 4 months of runway before enforcement starts.

The ones that wait get scramble mode and consultants billing $500/hour.

If you're in fintech, insurance, or banking and you haven't mapped your AI governance requirements yet — that's your Monday priority.
