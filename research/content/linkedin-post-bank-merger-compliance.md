# LinkedIn Post — Bank Merger Compliance AI (Draft for @AfrexAI)

---

Bank mergers doubled in 2025.

Know what else doubled? Compliance failures during integration.

When two banks merge, you're combining:
→ Two sets of regulatory obligations
→ Two compliance cultures
→ Two technology stacks full of gaps

The result? A 12-18 month window where compliance risk skyrockets and nobody has full visibility.

We've seen it play out with Synovus-Pinnacle, U.S. Bancorp-MUFG, and dozens of regional bank deals.

The compliance teams are stretched thin. The regulators don't care that you're "in transition." The fines don't wait for your integration timeline.

AI compliance monitoring solves the hardest part: continuous visibility across both legacy systems during the messy middle.

Instead of hoping your quarterly audit catches something, you know — in real time — where the gaps are.

The banks that figure this out will merge faster, integrate cheaper, and avoid the seven-figure enforcement actions that derail deals.

The ones that don't? They're paying the "we'll figure it out later" tax. And it's expensive.
