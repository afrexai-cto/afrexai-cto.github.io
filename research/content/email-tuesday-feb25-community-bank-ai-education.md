Hi [First Name],

Most community bank AI projects don't fail because the technology is wrong. They fail because the team doesn't know what to do with it.

Kevin Green from Hapax put it well this week: the gap isn't computational power — it's communication. Bankers need to understand what AI can actually do before they can apply it responsibly.

The CSI 2026 Banking Priorities Report backs this up. AI is now the #1 strategic priority for community banks, ahead of cybersecurity for the first time. But ambition is outpacing infrastructure — and more importantly, outpacing understanding.

We've seen this pattern at three community banks this quarter:
1. Executive team greenlights an AI initiative
2. IT picks a vendor tool
3. Six months later, it's a pilot that never reached production

The missing piece isn't the tool. It's having someone who's built these systems in production — who knows which workflows actually benefit from AI, which ones don't, and how to get past compliance review.

That's what we do at AfrexAI. We don't sell software. We deploy working AI agents into your operations and manage them — so your team focuses on banking, not debugging prompts.

If you're exploring AI strategy for 2026, Christina Beckford (our CEO) can walk through what's working at institutions your size in a 30-minute call.

## Targeting Notes:
- Send to community bank CEOs/COOs at $500M-$5B asset size
- Prioritize banks that have publicly discussed AI (Country Bank, Monson Savings, etc.)
- Reference Kevin Green / Hapax AI certification program as conversation starter if they engage
- Allica Bank (UK) showing 2-10x productivity gains — use as proof point in follow-up
