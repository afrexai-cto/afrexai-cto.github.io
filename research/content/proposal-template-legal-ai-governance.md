# AfrexAI — Legal AI Governance & Implementation Proposal

## [FIRM NAME] — Managed AI Agent Deployment

## The Problem

58% of legal professionals have adopted AI tools — but most deployments lack the governance controls that bar associations, clients, and regulators now demand.

Recent incidents underscore the urgency:
- **Microsoft Copilot privilege breach (Jan 2026):** AI read and summarized emails marked CONFIDENTIAL, including privileged legal communications. Active for 4 weeks before detection.
- **State bar guidance accelerating:** Florida, New York, California all updating AI ethics rules. Firms without documented governance face disciplinary exposure.
- **NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative (Feb 2026):** Federal framework for agent accountability, audit trails, and human oversight — White House-backed.

Mid-market firms (50-500 attorneys) face a specific bind: large enough to need AI to stay competitive, too small to build governance infrastructure internally.

## Our Solution: Managed AI Workforce with Built-In Governance

AfrexAI deploys production-ready AI agents with compliance controls from day one. Not tools you learn — outcomes you measure.

### Agent Deployment Options

| Agent | Function | Key Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Contract Review Agent** | Automated clause analysis, risk flagging, redline suggestions | 70-85% faster first-pass review, consistent risk identification |
| **Compliance & Ethics Agent** | Bar rule monitoring, AI usage logging, audit trail generation | Continuous compliance, audit-ready documentation |
| **Client Intake Agent** | Conflict checks, matter classification, engagement letter drafting | 50-60% faster intake, reduced conflicts exposure |
| **Research Agent** | Case law research, citation verification, memo drafting | 40-60% research time reduction, improved citation accuracy |

### Governance Controls (Standard on All Deployments)

- **Privilege protection:** All agent outputs tagged with matter/client identifiers. No cross-matter data leakage.
- **Audit logging:** Every agent action logged with timestamp, user, input/output hash. Exportable for bar inquiries.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** No client-facing output without attorney review. Configurable approval workflows.
- **Data isolation:** Client data never leaves your infrastructure. No model training on your data.
- **Ethics compliance:** Automated checks against jurisdiction-specific bar rules. Updated as guidance evolves.
