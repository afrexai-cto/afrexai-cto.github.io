## Your AI Workforce for Healthcare Operations

---

### The Problem
- **18% RN turnover** — admin burden is the #1 driver
- **$12-18M/year** spent on clinical documentation at mid-size health systems
- **HHS AI Governance Mandate (April 3, 2026)** — every health system needs AI bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, and human oversight frameworks NOW
- **3.2 hours/day** — time clinicians spend on documentation instead of patients

### The Solution: Managed AI Agents
We don't sell software. We deploy, manage, and optimize AI agent workforces that handle the operational work your clinical staff shouldn't be doing.

**Agent 1: Clinical Documentation Assistant**
- Real-time ambient documentation during patient encounters
- Auto-generates SOAP notes, discharge summaries, referral letters
- Integrates with Epic, Cerner, Meditech
- **Result:** 60-70% reduction in documentation time

**Agent 2: Claims & Prior Auth Processor**
- Automated prior authorization submissions
- Denial prediction and preemptive correction
- Real-time eligibility verification
- **Result:** 40% faster claim resolution, 25% fewer denials

**Agent 3: HHS Compliance Monitor**
- Continuous AI bias detection across all deployed models
- Outcome monitoring dashboards for CMS reporting
- Human oversight workflow enforcement
- **Result:** April 3 deadline compliance + ongoing audit readiness
