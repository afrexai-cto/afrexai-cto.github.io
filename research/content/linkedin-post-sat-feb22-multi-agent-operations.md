# LinkedIn Post — Saturday Feb 22, 2026
## "The chatbot era is officially over."

**Post:**

PYMNTS just published something every enterprise CTO should read.

"The industry is pivoting from generative AI to agentic AI — reorganizing around execution rather than just information retrieval."

Multi-agent systems. Not chatbots. Not copilots. Coordinated digital workforces where:
→ One agent harvests data
→ Another validates it
→ A third executes the transaction
→ A fourth ensures compliance

Capital One already embedded multi-agent workflows directly into operations. Not labs. Not pilots. Production.

Here's the gap nobody talks about:

95% of AI projects never make it past pilot (MIT). Not because the technology doesn't work — because nobody architects the orchestration layer.

Most enterprises are still building "smarter email" and "faster document summaries."

The winners are building AI operations teams.

That's exactly what we do at AfrexAI — deploy managed AI agent workforces that actually run business processes. Compliance-first. Governance built in. NIST-aligned.

The question isn't whether your company needs AI agents.

It's whether your agents are working together — or just answering prompts.
