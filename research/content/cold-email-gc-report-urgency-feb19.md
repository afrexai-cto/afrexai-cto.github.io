# Cold Email: General Counsel Report Urgency Angle
*Created: 2026-02-19 15:57 GMT | Source: FTI/Relativity 7th Annual GC Report (Feb 18, 2026)*

## Why This Works
- Published YESTERDAY — ultra-timely
- 97% of GCs report increased workload but only 39% use AI — 61% gap
- 70% discuss AI risk concerns — they WANT to adopt but need a trusted partner
- 57% paying more for disputes — cost pressure creates urgency

## Email A: "The 61% Gap"

**Subject lines (A/B/C):**
- A: "97% more work, 39% using AI — where does [FIRM] sit?"
- B: "The GC report dropped yesterday. One number stood out."
- C: "61% of legal teams are leaving money on the table"

**Body:**

Hi [FIRST NAME],

The FTI/Relativity General Counsel Report came out yesterday. Two numbers jumped out:

97% of GCs saw their workload increase.
Only 39% are using AI to handle it.

That's a 61% gap — and it maps directly to the firms paying 57% more for disputes and investigations this year.

We build AI agents that actually work inside legal workflows — contract review, compliance screening, document analysis. Not a chatbot. Not a platform you have to figure out. Working systems, managed end-to-end.

One of our implementations cut contract review time by 85% and saved $636K annually for a mid-market firm.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits [FIRM]'s situation?

## Follow-up (Day 7):

Subject: Re: [original subject]

[FIRST NAME] — quick follow-up on this.

The 70% of GCs who mentioned AI risk concerns in that report? That's exactly why we manage the full implementation — governance, compliance, security built in from day one.

Happy to share the ROI breakdown if useful.
