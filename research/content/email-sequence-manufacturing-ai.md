## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your ops team is doing work that shouldn't exist

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question — how many hours does your team spend each week on compliance documentation, quality reports, and production status updates?

For most manufacturers in the $50M-$500M range, the answer is 40-80 hours. Per week. Across the organization.

We built AI agents that handle that entire workflow — pulling data from your existing systems, generating reports, flagging anomalies, and filing compliance docs. No rip-and-replace. Works alongside what you already have.

One client saved $111K in the first engagement before we even finished delivery.

Worth 15 minutes to see if it fits your operation?

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Your ops team is doing work that shouldn't exist

{{first_name}} — one more data point.

90% of enterprise AI projects fail. Not because the tech doesn't work — because consultancies build demos, not production systems.

We do it differently:
- **Week 1:** Working demo on YOUR data (not a slide deck)
- **Fixed price.** If we go over budget, that's our problem
- **$40K recovery guarantee** in 90 days or we keep working free

The reason most AI fails in manufacturing? Nobody connects it to the actual shop floor systems. We do.

15-minute call — I'll show you exactly what it looks like for {{company}}.

## Email 3: The Break-Up (Day 7)

**Subject:** closing the loop

{{first_name}} — I'll keep this short.

If automating compliance reporting and quality documentation isn't a priority right now, totally get it. I'll back off.

But if it is and you just haven't had time — here's our 2-minute case study: [link to case study]

Either way, no hard feelings. Manufacturing moves fast.
