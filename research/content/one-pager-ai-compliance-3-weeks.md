# AfrexAI — AI Compliance in 3 Weeks
## One-Pager Sales Material

---

### The Problem
Colorado SB 24-205 went live **February 1, 2026**. HHS AI transparency rules hit healthcare orgs by mid-2026. CFPB is watching every fintech lender using AI in credit decisions.

Your compliance team is already behind. Building an AI governance framework from scratch takes 6-12 months with traditional consulting. You don't have that long.

### The Solution
AfrexAI deploys **AI compliance agents** that do in 3 weeks what takes consultants 6 months:

| What You Get | Timeline |
|---|---|
| Full AI inventory & risk assessment | Week 1 |
| Governance framework + policy drafts | Week 2 |
| Monitoring dashboards + audit trails | Week 3 |

### How It Works
1. **Discovery** — Our agents scan your AI systems, map data flows, and classify risk levels per SB 24-205 / HHS / CFPB requirements
2. **Build** — Auto-generate governance policies, impact assessments, and consumer notification templates tailored to your org
3. **Monitor** — Continuous compliance monitoring with alerting for algorithmic discrimination, model drift, and regulatory changes

### Why AfrexAI vs. Consultants

| | Traditional Consulting | AfrexAI |
|---|---|---|
| Timeline | 6-12 months | 3 weeks |
| Cost | $500K-$1M+ | Starting at $120K |
| Ongoing monitoring | Manual quarterly reviews | 24/7 automated |
| Scales with you | New SOW each time | Agents adapt automatically |

### Results
