**Subject:** Your core provider won't solve this for you

Hi [First Name],

Quick question — when was the last time your core service provider proactively helped you implement something that gave you a real competitive edge?

I ask because we've been watching the OCC's recent RFI on bank-fintech relationships, and the message is clear: regulators want banks to own their AI strategy, not outsource it to a CSP that treats innovation as an afterthought.

The data backs this up. ABA's latest survey shows community bank satisfaction with CSP innovation scoring below 3.2 out of 5. And 70%+ of community banks are served by just three providers who aren't keeping pace with AI.

We work with mid-market financial institutions to implement AI agents that actually run — compliance screening, document processing, customer service — managed end-to-end so your team doesn't need to become an AI shop overnight.

The firms moving now are the ones that'll have 12 months of production data when the OCC finalizes guidance. The ones waiting will be scrambling.

Worth a 15-minute conversation this week?

## Email 2 — Thursday Feb 27

**Subject:** Re: Your core provider won't solve this for you

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share something specific — we recently mapped out the 5 highest-ROI AI use cases for community banks in the $500M-$5B range:

1. KYC/AML screening automation (60-70% faster, fewer false positives)
2. Commercial loan document processing (hours → minutes)
3. Regulatory change monitoring (automated compliance updates)
4. Customer service agents (24/7 without headcount)
5. BSA/SAR filing preparation (audit-ready from day one)

Each of these pays for itself within 6 months. And none of them require ripping out your core system — they sit alongside it.

We build a working demo of #1 or #2 in 7 days. No charge, no commitment. If it doesn't blow your mind, we shake hands and part ways.

Interested?

## Email 3 — Tuesday Mar 3

**Subject:** Before the OCC drops guidance

Hi [First Name],

Last note on this. The OCC's RFI on bank-fintech relationships is collecting input through March. When final guidance drops, every community bank will need to demonstrate they have an AI governance framework — not just a vendor contract.

Three things we're seeing the sharpest banks do right now:
- Documenting AI decision-making processes before regulators ask
- Building explainability into every automated workflow
- Creating board-level AI oversight committees

We help with all three, and we do it without adding headcount or a 6-month consulting engagement.

Happy to send over our community banking AI readiness checklist — no strings. Just reply "send it" and it's yours.
