Insurance carriers are adding AI exclusions to D&O policies.

Let that sink in.

The same companies deploying AI across underwriting, claims, and fraud detection are telling their insureds: "If your AI causes harm, you're on your own."

Here's what that actually means:

**For insureds:** Your D&O policy might not cover AI-related decisions anymore. Board members making AI deployment calls could be personally exposed.

**For carriers:** You're creating a regulatory target on your back. State regulators in Connecticut, Colorado, and New York are watching. The NAIC Model Bulletin specifically addresses algorithmic accountability. You can't exclude what you're simultaneously selling.

**The real problem:** Most carriers don't have a systematic way to demonstrate their OWN AI is compliant. They're writing exclusions because they can't quantify the risk — not because the risk is unmanageable.

We've seen carriers go from "we can't underwrite AI risk" to "we have a governance framework that maps every model to every applicable regulation" in 90 days.

The carriers who figure out AI governance first won't just avoid regulatory action — they'll write the policies everyone else is too scared to offer.

That's not a cost center. That's a competitive moat.
