Google Ventures just led a $20M round into Complyance — an agentic AI company focused purely on compliance.

That's not a coincidence.

The EU AI Act's high-risk provisions kick in August 2, 2026. That's 167 days away. If you're deploying AI in financial services, healthcare, or legal — and you haven't started your compliance mapping — you're already behind.

Here's what most companies miss: the Act doesn't just regulate AI products. It regulates AI *systems*. That internal chatbot your team built? The document classifier in your claims workflow? The risk scoring model in your lending pipeline?

All potentially in scope.

Three things to do this week:

1. Inventory every AI system touching customers, employees, or regulated data
2. Classify each as minimal, limited, high, or unacceptable risk
3. Start documentation — the Act requires technical docs, risk assessments, and human oversight protocols for anything high-risk

The companies treating this as a "legal problem for later" will be the same ones scrambling in July.

We've been helping financial services and legal firms build AI agents with compliance baked in from day one. Not bolted on after.

If you want to see what that looks like, DM me.
