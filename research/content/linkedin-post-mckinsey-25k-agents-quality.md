# LinkedIn Post: McKinsey Has 25,000 AI Agents. EY Says That's the Wrong Metric.

McKinsey just bragged about deploying 25,000 AI agents in under two years.

EY's response? "Some of the best value we have is returned by just a handful of agents doing the heavy lifting."

PwC's Chief AI Officer said it bluntly: counting agents is "probably the wrong measure."

Here's what nobody's saying out loud:

Most of those 25,000 agents are glorified automations. Fancy if-then statements with an LLM wrapper.

The companies seeing real ROI aren't deploying thousands of agents. They're deploying 5-10 that actually work. Agents that handle compliance workflows end-to-end. That process clinical documentation without hallucinating. That review contracts faster than a junior associate — and more accurately.

Quality beats quantity. Every time.

The question isn't "how many agents do you have?"

It's "how many of your agents would you trust with a client-facing decision?"

That number is usually... much smaller.

We build the small number that actually matters.
