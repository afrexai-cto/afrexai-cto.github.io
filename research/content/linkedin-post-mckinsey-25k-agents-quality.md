*Hook: McKinsey vs EY debate on agent quantity vs quality*

---

McKinsey just bragged about deploying 25,000 AI agents in under two years.

EY's response? "That's probably the wrong measure."

PwC's Chief AI Officer agrees: quality beats quantity every time.

Here's the thing — they're ALL right and wrong simultaneously.

McKinsey is right that scale matters. You can't transform a 45,000-person firm with 3 agents.

But EY nails the real point: a handful of agents doing heavy lifting beats thousands doing busywork.

We see this with our enterprise clients every week:

→ Company A deploys 50 generic chatbots. Net impact: marginal.
→ Company B deploys 4 purpose-built AI agents for compliance, document review, and client intake. Net impact: $2M+ in recovered capacity.

The difference isn't the technology. It's the implementation.

The firms winning with AI agents right now share 3 traits:

1. They measure agent ROI the same way they measure employee ROI — by output, not headcount
2. They start with ONE high-value workflow, prove it, then expand
3. They have someone who actually understands the domain AND the tech

Gartner predicts 40%+ of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027.

Those will be the ones that chased quantity.

The ones that survive? They'll look a lot more like EY's "handful doing heavy lifting" than McKinsey's 25,000.

If your AI agent strategy is "deploy more," it's time to rethink.

If it's "deploy smarter" — let's talk.
