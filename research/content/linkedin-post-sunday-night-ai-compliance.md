# LinkedIn Post — Sunday Night Series: AI Compliance Countdown

**Theme: HHS AI deadline urgency**

63 companies got fined for AI compliance failures in 2025.

Not because their models were bad. Because their documentation was.

The HHS mandate hits April 3rd. That's 39 days.

Here's what most healthcare orgs are missing:

→ Risk classification for every AI system touching patient data
→ Human oversight protocols that actually hold up under audit
→ Bias testing documentation (not just "we checked")
→ Incident response plans specific to AI failures
→ Vendor AI governance requirements in contracts

We built a free compliance readiness assessment that scores you across all 8 dimensions the regulators care about.

Takes 10 minutes. Tells you exactly where your gaps are.
