**Subject:** Cincinnati's AI gap isn't vision — it's execution across 46 states

**Body:**

John,

You were one of the first Chief AI Officers in insurance. Most carriers are still arguing about whether to start. You're years ahead on strategy.

But here's what I keep hearing from CIOs in your position: scaling AI from pilot to production across thousands of employees is a different animal than proving the concept.

We help carriers like Cincinnati turn AI initiatives into measurable outcomes — compliance automation, claims triage, underwriting support — without the 18-month integration projects that kill momentum.

One client cut manual compliance review by 60% in the first 90 days. No rip-and-replace. Works alongside existing systems.

Worth a 20-minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
