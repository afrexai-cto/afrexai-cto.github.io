# LinkedIn Post — Weekend Push (Feb 20, 2026)

**For Christina to post Saturday AM EST (peak weekend engagement)**

CIO.com just published "4 AI Strategy Archetypes Every CIO Should Know" and the core insight confirms what we see with every client:

There is no single "right" AI strategy.

Organizations differ in two ways:
→ Their key levers to create value
→ The risk degree they can tolerate

Yet most AI consulting firms sell one-size-fits-all. "Here's your chatbot. Good luck."

The firms winning with AI right now aren't the ones who moved fastest. They're the ones who aligned AI to their actual business model first.

A compliance-heavy financial services firm needs a completely different AI implementation than a healthcare system fighting staff burnout.

At AfrexAI, we don't sell AI tools. We build AI workforces designed around YOUR value creation model and risk tolerance.

That's why our implementations stick when 95% of AI pilots fail (MIT).

If your AI strategy conversation still starts with "what tools should we buy?" — you're asking the wrong question.

Start with: what does our business actually need AI to DO?

**Notes:** Reference CIO.com article (Feb 20, 2026). Positions AfrexAI as the strategic implementation partner, not tool vendor. Pairs well with Friday post about McKinsey/GC stats.
