Infosys just partnered with Anthropic to build "enterprise-grade AI agents" for regulated industries.

Their AI services? $275 million last quarter. TCS? $1.8 billion a year.

Here's what nobody's talking about:

These giants are building AI agents for Fortune 500 banks and telecoms. But who's serving the 4,500+ community banks? The Am Law 100-200 firms? The mid-market health systems?

Nobody.

The Big 4 can't profitably serve a $500M-revenue bank. Their minimum engagement is larger than the bank's entire IT budget.

That's the gap.

Mid-market regulated companies need the same governance, the same compliance rigor, the same agentic AI capabilities — at a price point that makes sense.

They don't need a 200-person consulting team. They need 3-5 AI agents that actually work, managed by people who understand their regulations.

That's what we're building at AfrexAI.

While the giants fight over JPMorgan, we're making AI work for the other 99%.
