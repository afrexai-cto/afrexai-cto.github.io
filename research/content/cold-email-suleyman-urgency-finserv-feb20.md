# Cold Email — "The 18-Month Window" (Finserv / Legal / Healthcare)

## Version A — Financial Services CFO/COO

**Subject:** 12 months before your back office looks completely different

Hi [First Name],

Microsoft's AI chief just publicly stated that most white-collar tasks will be fully automated within 18 months.

Whether you agree with the timeline or not, the direction is clear. And in financial services, the firms that move first on compliance automation, claims processing, and risk monitoring will have a structural cost advantage that's nearly impossible to close.

The challenge we keep hearing from mid-market firms: "We know we need to move, but we don't have the internal AI team to actually implement."

That's exactly what we do at AfrexAI. We deploy managed AI agents — not prototypes, not demos — into regulated environments. KYC screening, document review, compliance monitoring. Production systems with human oversight built in.

One question: is AI implementation on your priority list for Q2, or is someone else on your team owning that?

Either way, happy to share what we're seeing work in the space.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Version B — Healthcare CIO/CDIO (HHS Deadline Angle)

**Subject:** 42 days until the HHS AI governance deadline

Hi [First Name],

Quick heads-up if it's not already on your radar — the HHS mandate requiring all divisions to adopt AI governance practices hits April 3rd. That's 42 days.

We've been helping health systems implement AI agents for clinical documentation and claims processing with governance baked in from day one — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, human oversight. The full checklist.

The good news: we can get a compliant pilot running in under 30 days. The better news: the same systems typically save 200-400 hours/month on documentation alone.

Would it make sense to have a 15-minute call next week to see if we can help before the deadline?

## Version C — Legal (GC Report Angle)

**Subject:** 97% of GCs report more work, only 39% using AI

Hi [First Name],

That stat comes from the latest FTI/Relativity GC Report. And the gap between workload growth and AI adoption is where firms are leaving money on the table.

Contract review alone — most firms we talk to are spending 15-20 hours per week on routine review that an AI agent handles in minutes. Not a chatbot. An actual trained agent that understands your clause library and flags deviations.

We deploy these as managed services, so your team doesn't need to become AI experts. We handle the implementation, monitoring, and optimization.

If contract volume is growing faster than headcount, might be worth a quick conversation.
