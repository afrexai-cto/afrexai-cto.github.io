# LinkedIn Post — Community Bank AI Success (Extraco Banks Case Study)
*Draft: Feb 21, 2026 | For AfrexAI company page*

A $2.5 billion community bank in Texas just showed everyone how it's done.

Extraco Banks unified 44 data sources across 8 lines of business. Result: 27% jump in campaign conversions and $63.6 million in added earning assets.

Not from a chatbot. From AI agents that their marketing, lending, and ops teams actually use — querying unified customer data in plain English.

Here's what most community banks get wrong:

They buy a tool. They bolt it onto broken processes. They wonder why nothing changes.

Extraco did the opposite. They started with the data problem. Unified everything first. Then layered AI agents on top of clean, connected data.

That's the pattern we see with every successful AI deployment:

1. Fix the foundation (data, processes, governance)
2. Deploy agents that work WITH your team, not instead of them  
3. Measure real business outcomes, not "AI usage metrics"

CSI's 2026 survey says 27% of community bank leaders now rank AI as their #1 priority — ahead of cybersecurity for the first time.

But understanding AI ≠ deploying it successfully.

The implementation gap is where the money is. And where most banks are stuck.

If your AI strategy is still "we're evaluating vendors" — your competitors are already measuring ROI.
