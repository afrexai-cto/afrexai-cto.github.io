# LinkedIn Post: Bank CEOs Are Taking the AI Wheel

**Draft — Feb 19, 2026 | For AfrexAI company page**

70% of bank CEOs say they're personally leading AI strategy.

Not their CTO. Not their CIO. Them.

(BCG survey, this week.)

Here's what that tells me:

They tried delegating AI. It didn't work. Pilots stalled. Departments fought over budget. Nothing shipped.

So now the CEO is in the room, spending 7 hours a week just learning about AI.

But knowing about AI and deploying AI agents that actually move money, flag compliance violations, and orchestrate treasury workflows — those are very different things.

PYMNTS reported this week that banks are shifting from chatbot experiments to autonomous agents handling AML investigations, cash flow optimization, and payment routing. Real operations. Real authority.

The gap isn't knowledge. It's implementation capacity.

Most banks don't have the team to go from "AI strategy deck" to "agents running in production with audit trails regulators will accept."

That's the work we do.

If you're a bank CEO spending 7 hours a week on AI strategy and zero hours seeing agents in production — that's the problem worth solving.
