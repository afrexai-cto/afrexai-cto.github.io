## Email 1: Ilona Logvinova — Chief AI Officer, HSF Kramer

**Subject:** Quick question ahead of Legalweek

Hi Ilona,

Congrats on the Chief AI Officer role at HSF Kramer — building a global AI strategy from scratch after the Herbert Smith Freehills merger is no small mandate.

I'm Christina Beckford, CEO of AfrexAI. We build managed AI agent workforces for professional services firms. Not chatbots — actual autonomous agents that handle contract review, due diligence triage, and compliance monitoring end-to-end.

I noticed you joined from McKinsey's legal practice, so you already know the gap between "AI strategy" and "AI that actually works in production." That gap is exactly what we close.

Would you have 20 minutes at Legalweek (March 9-12) to compare notes on what's working in legal AI deployment? I'd genuinely value your perspective — and I think our approach to agent orchestration might accelerate some of what you're building.

No pitch deck, just coffee and honest conversation.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: Greg Lambert — Chief Innovation Officer, Jackson Walker

**Subject:** First CINO at Jackson Walker — would love to connect at Legalweek

Hi Greg,

Being Jackson Walker's first-ever CINO is a unique position — you're essentially defining what innovation means for the whole firm. That's exciting and daunting in equal measure.

I'm Christina from AfrexAI. We deploy managed AI agent teams for law firms. Think of it as hiring a small AI department instead of building one. Our agents handle document review, contract analysis, and compliance workflows — the stuff that eats associate hours.

I've been following the AI adoption curve in Am Law firms and the pattern is clear: firms that move from "experimenting" to "deploying" in 2026 will have a 2-year head start on everyone else.

Are you heading to Legalweek March 9-12? Would love to grab coffee and hear how you're thinking about the innovation roadmap. Happy to share what we're seeing work across similar-sized firms.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 3: Anni Datesh — Chief Innovation Officer, Wilson Sonsini

**Subject:** Saw you're speaking at Legalweek — would love to connect

Hi Anni,

I saw you're on the speaker lineup for Legalweek — excited to hear your take on where legal innovation is heading. Wilson Sonsini's position at the intersection of tech and law makes your perspective especially interesting.

I'm Christina Beckford, CEO of AfrexAI. We provide managed AI agent workforces to professional services firms. Not tools, not platforms — actual working agents that run autonomously on contract review, compliance monitoring, and research tasks.

Given Wilson Sonsini's tech-forward client base, I suspect you're fielding questions about AI deployment from both sides — internally for the firm and externally from clients. Would love to compare notes on what you're seeing.

Would you have 15-20 minutes between sessions at Legalweek? Coffee's on me.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
