**Subject:** AI governance at CHOP — April 3 is closer than it looks

Hi Shakeeb,

I caught your healthsystemCIO interview where you talked about CHOP's three-pillar approach to digital transformation — AI and automation, digital access, and extending care into the home. Really thoughtful framework, especially the emphasis on solving real clinical problems rather than chasing trends.

With the HHS AI governance mandate hitting April 3, a lot of health systems are scrambling to stand up bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, and human oversight processes. Your team is clearly ahead of most, but even well-prepared organizations are finding gaps when they map existing workflows against the full mandate.

We've been helping health systems deploy managed AI agents that handle the operational heavy lifting — clinical documentation, claims processing, prior auth — with governance baked in from day one. Not another platform to manage. Working agents, managed end-to-end.

Would a 20-minute call next week make sense? Happy to share what we're seeing across pediatric systems specifically.

Best,
Christina Beckford

Hi Shakeeb,

Quick follow-up — wanted to share one data point that might be useful regardless of whether we connect.

One mid-sized health system we worked with reduced clinical documentation time by 40% in 8 weeks using managed AI agents, while meeting every requirement in the HHS governance framework. The key was treating AI governance not as a compliance checkbox but as an operational advantage.

Given CHOP's scale across 50+ care sites, that kind of time savings compounds fast. Happy to walk through the specifics if useful.

## Email 3 — Day 10 (Break-up)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

Hi Shakeeb,

Don't want to clutter your inbox — I know you're managing a lot across CHOP's digital transformation.

If AI governance readiness or managed AI agents are on the roadmap for 2026, I'd welcome the conversation whenever timing works. No pressure.

Either way, best of luck with the April 3 deadline prep. CHOP's approach to this stuff is genuinely impressive.

Christina
