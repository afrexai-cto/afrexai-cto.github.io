## Email 1 — The Hook (Day 1)

**Subject:** Compliance after CFPB — what changes?

Sean,

After the 2023 CFPB order, I'd imagine compliance monitoring at Enova looks very different than it did two years ago.

We work with fintech lenders to deploy AI agents that continuously monitor lending workflows for regulatory violations — the kind of systematic issues that manual reviews miss until it's too late.

One client reduced compliance incidents by 73% in 90 days. No rip-and-replace — sits on top of existing systems.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits your setup?

## Email 2 — The Value (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Compliance after CFPB — what changes?

Sean,

Quick follow-up. Three things our AI agents catch that traditional compliance can't:

1. **Pattern drift** — when lending practices slowly deviate from policy (exactly what triggered CFPB actions industry-wide)
2. **Multi-state regulatory conflicts** — automated cross-referencing across 50 state frameworks in real time
3. **Consumer complaint prediction** — flagging accounts likely to generate complaints before they do

We built this specifically for online lenders operating at scale. Happy to walk through a demo tailored to Enova's lending products.

## Email 3 — The Close (Day 9)

**Subject:** Quick question, Sean

Sean,

Not trying to fill your inbox — just genuinely think there's a fit here.

Fintech lenders with prior enforcement actions face 3x the scrutiny on their next exam. AI-driven compliance monitoring is becoming table stakes for companies in that position.

If the timing isn't right, no worries. But if you're evaluating compliance tech this year, I'd rather you see what we've built before committing elsewhere.

Open to a 15-min call this week or next?

— Christina
