## Email 1 — Day 0 (Initial Outreach)

**Subject:** Donegal's 22-state AI compliance exposure

Sanjay,

Donegal operates across 22 states — which means you're dealing with 22 different regulatory approaches to AI in insurance. Colorado SB21-169 is already enforced. Connecticut, Illinois, and Virginia are next.

We built an AI governance framework specifically for mid-market carriers like Donegal. It maps every model you're using to the regulatory requirements in each state you write in — and keeps it current as new rules hit.

One carrier we worked with had 14 undocumented AI touchpoints in their claims workflow alone. They didn't know until a regulator asked.

Would a 20-minute walkthrough of what a state-by-state AI compliance map looks like be useful? Happy to build a draft one for Donegal.

## Email 2 — Day 3 (Value Add)

**Subject:** Re: Donegal's 22-state AI compliance exposure

Quick follow-up — we published a free insurance AI compliance ROI calculator that estimates your regulatory risk exposure based on premium volume and state count.

For a carrier Donegal's size, we typically see $2-4M in avoidable regulatory risk annually.

Worth 2 minutes if you're curious.

## Email 3 — Day 7 (Social Proof)

**Subject:** How carriers are handling the AI audit wave

Sanjay — the NAIC Model Bulletin is pushing state DOIs to start requesting AI governance documentation. Colorado's already doing it.

Mid-market carriers are the most exposed because they lack the dedicated compliance teams that the top 20 have, but they're deploying the same AI tools.

We help carriers get audit-ready in 3 weeks, not 3 quarters. Happy to share how.

## Email 4 — Day 14 (Breakup)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

Sanjay — I'll assume the timing isn't right and won't follow up again.

If AI compliance becomes a priority (especially with Colorado and Connecticut enforcement ramping up), we're at afrexai.com.
