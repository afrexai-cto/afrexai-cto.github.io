# LinkedIn Post: HHS AI Governance — 43 Days

43 days.

That's how long healthcare organizations have until the HHS AI governance mandate kicks in on April 3.

Every division using AI needs documented bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security controls, and human oversight.

Here's the problem: most health systems can't even tell you how many AI tools they're running. Let alone prove they're governing them.

And "we'll figure it out next quarter" isn't a compliance strategy.

What we're seeing from clients:
→ AI tool inventories that take weeks to compile (because nobody tracked them)
→ Governance frameworks that exist on paper but aren't operationalized
→ IT teams stretched too thin to build monitoring from scratch

The organizations that move now will be compliant by April 3.

The ones that wait will be scrambling — or worse, non-compliant.

We've been deploying AI governance agents that handle the monitoring, documentation, and audit trails automatically. 3 weeks from kickoff to operational.

If you're a healthcare CTO or CAIO staring at this deadline, DM me. Happy to share what's working.
