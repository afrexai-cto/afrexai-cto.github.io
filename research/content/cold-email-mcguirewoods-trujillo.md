## Email 1 — Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Quick question about your AI rollout at McGuireWoods

**Body:**

Tom,

Saw McGuireWoods created the Chief Innovation & AI Officer role — smart move given where legal AI is heading.

Curious: are you seeing the same pattern we hear from other Am Law firms? Attorneys trial 3-4 AI tools, adoption plateaus at 15-20%, and the firm ends up paying for seats nobody uses.

We solve that specific problem. Our team deploys managed AI agents that handle contract review, due diligence, and document drafting — not as another tool attorneys have to learn, but as workflows that run in the background. Troutman Pepper's team runs 3,000+ AI prompts daily with a similar approach.

Would a 15-minute call make sense to compare notes on what's working in legal AI adoption?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your AI rollout at McGuireWoods

Tom,

One thing I forgot to mention — we built an AI governance readiness checklist that's been useful for firms navigating the new compliance landscape. Happy to share it, no strings attached.

The firms getting the most traction with AI aren't buying platforms. They're deploying purpose-built agents for specific workflows (contract review, research summaries, billing optimization) and measuring ROI per use case.

Worth a quick chat?

## Email 3 — Follow-up (Day 7)

**Subject:** McGuireWoods + AI agents — last note

Tom,

Not trying to clog your inbox. Just one data point:

A mid-market firm we worked with cut contract review time by 60% in the first month — not with a generic AI tool, but with agents trained specifically on their clause library and risk framework.

If that's the kind of result you're after, I'd love 15 minutes. If not, no hard feelings.

Christina
