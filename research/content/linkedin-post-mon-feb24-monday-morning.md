Most CTOs start Monday morning the same way:

Checking which AI pilot broke over the weekend.

MIT found 95% of enterprise AI projects never reach production. Not because the models are bad — because nobody planned for what happens after the demo.

We talked to 40+ mid-market companies last month. Same story every time:

→ Bought an AI tool in Q4
→ IT spent 3 months integrating it
→ It works in staging
→ Nobody trusts it in production
→ It sits there burning budget

The gap isn't technology. It's implementation.

The companies winning with AI right now aren't the ones with the fanciest models. They're the ones who figured out governance, monitoring, and human oversight before they deployed.

That's what we build at AfrexAI. Not another tool. The implementation layer that gets AI from "cool demo" to "running in production with audit trails."

If your Monday morning includes checking on a stalled AI project, we should talk.
