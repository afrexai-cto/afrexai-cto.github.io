**Subject:** $177B in coordination waste — and what your competitors are doing about it

Hi [Name],

Quick question: how much time does your team spend chasing RFIs, coordinating subs, and manually tracking safety compliance across jobsites?

Industry data says construction loses $177 billion annually to coordination failures alone. And with 650,000+ unfilled positions nationally, throwing more people at the problem isn't an option anymore.

We've been working with mid-market firms to deploy AI agents that handle the operational grind — RFI routing, safety documentation, schedule conflict detection — so your project managers can focus on building.

Not a platform you need to learn. Not a chatbot. A managed AI workforce that plugs into your existing tools (Procore, PlanGrid, whatever you're running) with full audit trails and human oversight built in.

Brasfield & Gorrie's reputation for innovation (the AR/VR and drone work caught our attention) suggests you're already thinking about this. Happy to share what's working for similar firms.

Our CEO Christina Beckford has 15 minutes this week if you're curious: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
Kalin Smolichki
CTO, AfrexAI

**Notes:**
- Uses $177B waste stat from PYMNTS Feb 10 research
- References their known innovation work (AR/VR, drones) for personalization
- Governance angle baked in ("audit trails and human oversight")
- Construction vertical has ZERO competitors positioning managed AI agents for mid-market contractors
