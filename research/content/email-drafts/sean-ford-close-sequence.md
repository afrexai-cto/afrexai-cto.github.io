## Email 2 — Monday Feb 24, 10:00 AM EST
**From:** ksmolichki@afrexai.com
**Subject:** Re: Your AI Agent Setup — Quick Question
**To:** Sean Ford

Sean,

Following up from Christina's email Saturday — she mentioned the agent configs you downloaded from our setup wizard.

Quick question: which of the 8 areas you flagged is costing you the most time right now? Lead follow-up? Transaction coordination? Something else?

We've found that starting with ONE agent that handles the biggest time sink gets clients to ROI fastest. For real estate operators like you, that's usually lead qualification — the agents handle initial inquiries 24/7, qualify against your criteria, and only surface the ones worth your time.

The $750 intro month covers setup, hosting, and ongoing management. We handle everything — you just tell us what "qualified" looks like.

Worth a 15-min call this week?

Best,
Kalin Smolichki
CTO, AfrexAI

P.S. If you want to skip the call and just get started, reply with your top pain point and we'll have a proposal back same day.

## Email 3 — Wednesday Feb 26 (only if no reply to #2)
**Subject:** Re: Your AI Agent Setup — Quick Question
**To:** Sean Ford

Sean,

Didn't want this to get buried — the setup wizard configs you downloaded are solid, but they need infrastructure to run on (server, monitoring, updates).

That's literally what we do: we take those configs, deploy them on dedicated infrastructure, and manage them so they actually work day-to-day.

Most real estate operators we talk to are losing 10-15 hours/week on tasks an AI agent handles in seconds. At your billing rate, that's $2,000-3,000/month in recovered time — vs. $750 for the first month.

Christina's calendar is open Thursday or Friday if you want to walk through it: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

## Email 4 — Friday Feb 28 (only if no reply to #2 or #3)
**Subject:** Last thought on the agent setup
**To:** Sean Ford

Sean,

Last note on this — the configs from the wizard expire after 30 days (the market data and compliance rules we baked in get stale). If you want to activate them, this week is the window.

Happy to answer any questions over email if a call isn't your thing. What's holding you back?

Kalin
