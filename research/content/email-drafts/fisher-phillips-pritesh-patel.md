Pritesh,

Congrats on the Director of AI role at Fisher Phillips — first hire like that for the firm, which tells me there's real commitment behind it.

Coming from Walmart's AI org into a 600-attorney firm, you're probably mapping out where agents can move the needle fastest. We've been building AI agent systems for professional services firms — the pattern we see is that intake triage + document review + compliance monitoring are where firms recover the most billable hours.

We built Verdict AI specifically for legal operations: autonomous agents that handle the repetitive workflow steps attorneys shouldn't be doing manually. One deployment recovered 40+ hours/week for a mid-size firm's compliance team.

Would it be useful to see how that maps to labor & employment specifically? Our CEO Christina Beckford can walk through it in 20 minutes: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
Kalin Smolichki
CTO, AfrexAI
