Subject: States are using AI to catch non-compliant AI

Hi [First Name],

Here's something most teams haven't caught yet: state regulators are now deploying AI to audit companies' own AI systems.

Montana is leading the charge. California's Fair Political Practices Commission is scaling it. And with NIST publishing federal agent standards this year, the compliance bar is about to get a lot higher.

The question isn't whether your AI works. It's whether your AI can survive an AI-powered audit.

Most enterprises we talk to deployed agents fast — for fraud detection, workflow automation, document processing. But governance was an afterthought. Now the regulators have better tools than the companies they're auditing.

We help mid-market firms close that gap in 3 weeks:
- Full agent inventory and risk assessment
- Governance framework aligned to NIST AI Agent Standards
- Audit-ready documentation and monitoring

If this is on your radar for Q2, our CEO Christina Beckford can walk through what the remediation looks like: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
Kalin Smolichki
CTO, AfrexAI

**Expected impact:** Compliance fear + regulatory urgency = fastest conversion lever. This targets a buyer persona (Chief Risk/Compliance Officer) we haven't directly addressed yet.
