## "McKinsey Has 25,000 AI Agents. EY Says That's the Wrong Metric."

---

McKinsey just announced 25,000 AI agents added in under two years.

EY's response? "A handful of agents do the heavy lifting."

PwC's chief AI officer called agent count "the wrong measure."

Here's what none of them are saying out loud:

Their clients — mid-market companies with $500M-$5B in revenue — can't replicate any of this.

McKinsey built 25,000 agents FOR MCKINSEY. Not for you.

The consulting firms are using AI to make themselves more profitable. And then charging you $2M to tell you to do the same thing.

But here's the real number that matters:

→ 78% of enterprises adopted AI in 2024 (Stanford HAI)
→ Only 15% successfully scaled beyond pilots
→ That 63% gap? That's where the money is. And the pain.

You don't need 25,000 agents.

You need 3-5 agents that actually work. In production. Governed. Compliant. Generating ROI you can measure.

Quality > quantity. Every time.

The question isn't "how many agents do you have?"

It's "how many are in production, and what's the ROI?"
