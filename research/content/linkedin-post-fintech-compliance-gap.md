# LinkedIn Post: The Fintech Compliance Gap
*Draft: 2026-02-16 | For: AfrexAI Company Page / Christina*

Banks spent $61 billion on compliance last year.

Most of that money went to humans doing repetitive screening work that AI handles in seconds.

Here's what's actually happening in fintech compliance right now:

→ Basel III.1 is tightening capital requirements
→ SEC now requires AI disclosure for trading firms  
→ AML/KYC screening volume is up 300% since 2020
→ The average compliance team is 40% understaffed

And yet most "AI compliance solutions" are glorified chatbots that can't actually DO the work.

The firms winning right now aren't buying another dashboard.

They're deploying AI agents that:
- Screen transactions against sanctions lists in real-time
- Flag suspicious patterns humans miss
- Generate regulatory reports automatically
- Cut false positive rates by 70%+

We've seen mid-market firms ($500M-$5B revenue) cut compliance costs by 35-50% in the first 90 days.

Not with a 12-month "digital transformation."

With working AI agents, deployed in weeks.

If your compliance team is drowning in manual screening, there's a faster way.
