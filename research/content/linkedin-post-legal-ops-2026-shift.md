Legal operations just hit an inflection point.

Wolters Kluwer's latest research shows legal ops teams in 2026 are prioritizing three things:

1. Data-driven law firm relationships (no more blind rate negotiations)
2. Scaling AI to eliminate administrative burden
3. Evolving team roles toward high-value decision-making

Meanwhile, Thomson Reuters reports law firms had record-breaking 2025 revenue — but 2026 rate increases are already causing client pushback.

Here's what nobody's saying out loud:

Corporate legal departments are sitting on millions in inefficiency. Document drafting alone eats 56% of lawyer time. Rate freezes and billing audits are band-aids.

The real move? AI agents that handle the repeatable work — contract review, compliance checks, document assembly — so your $500/hr attorneys focus on judgment calls that actually need them.

We're building exactly this at AfrexAI. Not another copilot. Autonomous agents that run your legal workflows end-to-end.

If your legal department is still debating whether to "explore AI" in 2026, you're already behind.
