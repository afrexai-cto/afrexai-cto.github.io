# Healthcare HHS AI Deadline — 3-Email Urgency Sequence
*Created: 2026-02-19 22:57 GMT | Target: Healthcare CIOs, CDOs, Chief AI Officers*

## Context
- HHS mandate: all divisions must adopt AI governance practices by **April 3, 2026** (43 days away)
- Deloitte survey (Feb 2026): 40% of health system tech execs say talent constraints easing, but scaling beyond pilots remains the gap
- Becker's (Feb 2026): CIOs moving from "experimentation" to "disciplined, scalable AI" — but most don't have the team to execute
- Cleveland Clinic, UMMS publicly investing in AI as core infrastructure, not experimental

## Target Profile
- Title: CIO, CDO, CISO, VP of IT, Chief AI Officer, Chief Digital Transformation Officer
- Org: Mid-market health systems (500-5,000 beds), regional hospital networks, large physician groups
- Pain: HHS deadline pressure + workforce strain + margin pressure + need to show AI ROI fast
- Named targets from Becker's 135 CIOs list: Ryan Vervack (UMMS CTO), Rohit Chandra (Cleveland Clinic CDO), Michael Archuleta (Mt. San Rafael CIO), Crystal Broj (MUSC CDTO)

## Email 1: "43 Days to HHS AI Compliance" (Hook)

**Subject A:** April 3 is 43 days away. Is your AI governance ready?
**Subject B:** The HHS AI deadline most health systems are ignoring

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: does your team have documented AI governance practices that cover bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, and human oversight?

Because by April 3, every HHS division needs exactly that. And from what we're seeing, most health systems are still in pilot mode.

Deloitte just surveyed 100 health system tech execs — the good news is adoption hurdles are easing. The bad news? Scaling beyond pilots is still the gap. And the deadline doesn't care about your pilot timeline.

We help health systems deploy working AI agents — not PowerPoint strategies — for clinical documentation, claims processing, and compliance monitoring. Our clients go from zero to production in 30 days.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense? I can walk you through exactly what "HHS-ready AI governance" looks like in practice.

Best,

## Email 2: "What Cleveland Clinic Gets Right" (Proof) — Send Day 5

**Subject:** How top health systems are treating AI as infrastructure, not experiments

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Cleveland Clinic's CDO said something that stuck with me: they're using AI as "a catalyst for enhancing quality and safety — making it smarter, more predictive, and patient-focused."

Not experimenting. Not piloting. Using.

Meanwhile, Becker's reports that most health system CIOs are still trying to move from experimentation to disciplined, scalable deployment. The gap between "top 10%" and everyone else is widening fast.

Here's what we've seen separate the leaders:
1. They treat AI agents as workforce, not tools
2. They have governance baked in from day one (not bolted on after audits)
3. They deploy in weeks, not quarters

We built our healthcare AI practice specifically for this moment — the HHS deadline creates urgency, but the real win is operational efficiency that compounds. Every $1 in AI returns $3.70 (Google Cloud data).

Want to see what a 30-day deployment looks like for [Org Name]?

## Email 3: "Last Check Before April" (Breakup) — Send Day 12

**Subject:** Closing the loop on AI governance

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I know inbox noise is real, so I'll keep this short.

April 3 is coming fast. If your team already has AI governance locked down — great, ignore me.

If not, our free AI Revenue Leak Calculator shows exactly where health systems lose money to manual processes: https://afrexai-cto.github.io/ai-revenue-calculator/

Takes 2 minutes. No email required.

Either way, wishing you a smooth path to compliance.
