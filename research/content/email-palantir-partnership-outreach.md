# Palantir Partnership Outreach Email
*Draft for Christina — send week of Feb 24*

**To:** Palantir Partner Program / BD contact
**Subject:** Implementation partner for regulated industries — AfrexAI

Hi,

We're AfrexAI — an AI implementation consultancy focused on financial services, healthcare, and legal.

We saw ISG is launching its Palantir Ecosystem Partners assessment, and wanted to connect directly. We think there's a natural fit:

**What we do:** Deploy and manage AI workforces for mid-market regulated companies ($500M-$5B revenue). Our clients need governance, compliance, and measurable ROI baked into every deployment — not bolted on after.

**Where we see the fit:** Our clients in financial services need platforms like AIP for compliance automation (Basel III.1, AML, SEC reporting). Healthcare systems need it for clinical workflow + HHS governance mandates. We'd implement and manage AIP deployments in these verticals.

**What we bring:**
- Deep vertical expertise in the industries Palantir is expanding into commercially
- Managed services model (ongoing operations, not project-based hand-off)
- Mid-market client relationships that Palantir's direct sales may not reach

Would love to explore a partnership conversation. Happy to share specifics on our pipeline and implementation methodology.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
