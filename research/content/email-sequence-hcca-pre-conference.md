# HCCA Pre-Conference Email Sequence
## Target: Healthcare Compliance Officers attending HCCA 30th Annual (April 27-30, Orlando)

### Email 1 — 6 weeks before (March 16)

**Subject:** Heading to HCCA in Orlando?

Hi [Name],

Saw you're connected to the healthcare compliance space — are you heading to Orlando for HCCA's 30th Annual in April?

We're presenting on something that's been keeping compliance officers up at night: getting AI governance frameworks operational before HHS enforcement tightens. Most health systems are still stuck in "committee mode" — we built a 3-week deployment that actually ships.

If you're attending, I'd love to grab 15 minutes over coffee to share what we've seen work (and what definitely doesn't) across health systems tackling this.

No pitch — just comparing notes with people who live this every day.

### Email 2 — 3 weeks before (April 6)

**Subject:** Quick prep for HCCA Orlando

Hi [Name],

Three weeks out from HCCA. We just published a free AI governance readiness checklist — covers the HHS transparency requirements, risk classification, and the documentation gaps we see in almost every health system.

Figured it might be useful prep: [link to checklist]

If your team is actively working on AI governance, happy to do a quick call before the conference so we can have a more focused conversation in Orlando.

### Email 3 — 1 week before (April 20)

**Subject:** See you in Orlando next week?

Hi [Name],

Final HCCA prep mode. Our session covers the 3-week AI governance framework — what most health systems get wrong and the exact sequence that works.

We have a few open slots for 1-on-1 meetings during the conference. If you want a candid assessment of where your AI governance stands relative to peers, grab a time here: [calendly link]

See you there.

### Post-Conference Follow-up (May 1)

**Subject:** Good connecting at HCCA — next steps

Hi [Name],

Great meeting you at HCCA. The conversation around [specific topic discussed] was exactly the kind of thing we're seeing across health systems right now.

As promised, here's [specific resource mentioned]. 

If your team wants to explore the 3-week governance framework we discussed, I can set up a deeper dive with our technical team. No pressure — just want to make sure you have what you need.
