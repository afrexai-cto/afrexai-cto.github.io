# Competitive Intel: Infosys × Anthropic Partnership
*Date: Feb 17-21, 2026*

## What Happened
- Infosys partnered with Anthropic to integrate Claude models into Infosys Topaz AI platform
- Focus: "enterprise-grade agentic AI" for banking, telecoms, manufacturing
- Announced at India AI Impact Summit, New Delhi
- Infosys AI revenue: $275M/quarter (5.5% of total). TCS: $1.8B/year (6%)

## Key Quotes
- **Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO):** "There's a big gap between an AI model that works in a demo and one that works in a regulated industry — and if you want to close that gap, you need domain expertise."
- **TechCrunch:** "The partnership offers Anthropic a route into heavily regulated enterprise sectors where deploying AI at scale requires industry expertise and governance capabilities."

## Implications for AfrexAI
1. **VALIDATES our thesis** — even Anthropic says regulated industries need domain experts, not just models
2. **Infosys targets Fortune 500** — mid-market is wide open for us
3. **"Agentic AI" is now mainstream terminology** — use it freely in all materials
4. **Governance = table stakes** — every competitor now leads with governance. We must too.

## Our Counter-Positioning
- Infosys = 300K+ employees, $18B revenue. Min engagement $500K+.
- AfrexAI = lean, vertical-specific, mid-market sweet spot ($140K-$800K ACV)
- We don't sell platform licenses. We sell working AI agents, managed.
- "While they're building Topaz integrations for Citibank, we're making AI work for community banks and Am Law 200 firms."

## Action Items
