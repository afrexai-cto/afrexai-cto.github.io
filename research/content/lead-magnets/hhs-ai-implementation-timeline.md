## The Deadline

On April 3, 2026, the HHS mandate requires all divisions to adopt AI governance practices covering:
- **Bias mitigation** in clinical and operational AI
- **Outcome monitoring** with defined metrics
- **Security controls** for AI systems handling PHI
- **Human oversight** protocols for AI-assisted decisions

Non-compliance risks: audit findings, funding implications, reputational damage.

## 44-Day Implementation Timeline (Feb 18 → April 3)

### Week 1-2 (Feb 18 - Mar 3): INVENTORY & ASSESS
- [ ] Catalog all AI systems in use (clinical + operational)
- [ ] Map each system to HHS governance requirements
- [ ] Identify gaps: which systems lack bias testing, monitoring, or oversight?
- [ ] Assign governance owner per AI system
- [ ] Document current human oversight protocols

**Deliverable:** AI System Inventory + Gap Analysis Report

### Week 3-4 (Mar 4 - Mar 17): POLICY & FRAMEWORK
- [ ] Draft AI Governance Policy (bias, monitoring, security, oversight)
- [ ] Define outcome metrics for each AI system
- [ ] Establish bias testing cadence (quarterly minimum)
- [ ] Create incident response plan for AI failures/errors
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards (accuracy, fairness, drift)
- [ ] Define escalation paths: when does AI decision → human review?

**Deliverable:** AI Governance Policy v1.0 + Monitoring Framework

### Week 5-6 (Mar 18 - Mar 31): IMPLEMENT & TRAIN
- [ ] Deploy monitoring tools on all cataloged AI systems
- [ ] Run initial bias audit on highest-risk systems (clinical decision support)
- [ ] Train department heads on oversight protocols
- [ ] Document security controls (access, encryption, audit logs)
- [ ] Conduct tabletop exercise: "AI system produces biased output — now what?"
- [ ] Brief board/leadership on compliance status

**Deliverable:** Monitoring Live + Training Complete + Board Brief

### Week 7 (Apr 1-3): VALIDATE & CERTIFY
- [ ] Internal audit of governance controls
- [ ] Final gap remediation
- [ ] Executive sign-off on compliance posture
- [ ] Archive evidence package (policies, training records, audit results)

**Deliverable:** Compliance Ready — Evidence Package Complete

## Common Pitfalls

1. **"We only have one AI tool"** — Check again. Many systems embed AI (EHR clinical decision support, imaging, scheduling optimization, coding assistants). Most health systems have 15-30+ AI-enabled tools.

2. **"IT owns this"** — HHS expects clinical and operational oversight, not just technical controls. CMIO/CNO/CMO need to be at the table.

3. **"We'll handle it after April 3"** — First audit cycles will look at whether governance was in place BY the deadline, not when you started.
