AI just became the #1 strategic priority for community banks.

Not cybersecurity. Not digital payments. Not core modernization.

AI.

CSI's 2026 Banking Priorities report found something most vendors won't tell you: community banks aren't asking "should we use AI?" anymore.

They're asking "why can't we make it work?"

The answer is buried in the same report: legacy systems, fragmented data, and aging cores are blocking every AI initiative that gets past the pilot stage.

Here's what that means in practice:

→ Your AI vendor demos beautifully on clean data
→ Your actual data lives in 4 different systems that don't talk to each other
→ The pilot "succeeds" but never scales
→ The board asks why you spent $200K on a chatbot

The banks that are winning aren't buying AI tools. They're building AI operations — with governance, data integration, and managed workflows that actually survive contact with production.

That's what we do at AfrexAI. Not another platform. Not another chatbot. A managed AI workforce that works inside your existing infrastructure, passes examiner review, and scales past the pilot.

95% of AI projects fail to reach production. We exist for the 5% that need to work.
