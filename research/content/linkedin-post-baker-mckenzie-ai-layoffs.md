Baker McKenzie just cut up to 1,000 support staff.

Their reason? AI.

But here's what nobody's talking about:

It wasn't the lawyers who got fired. It was research, marketing, secretarial, and know-how teams.

The people who make the lawyers productive.

And Baker McKenzie isn't alone. Over 54,000 layoffs cited AI as the reason last year.

Here's the uncomfortable truth most firms won't admit:

Replacing support staff with AI without a proper implementation strategy is like firing your kitchen staff and handing the chef a microwave.

Sure, food still comes out. But your Michelin star? Gone.

The firms that will win aren't the ones cutting headcount fastest.

They're the ones using AI to make their EXISTING teams 10x more productive.

We're working with legal, financial services, and healthcare firms to deploy AI agents that:

→ Cut document review time by 70%
→ Automate compliance workflows that eat 15+ hours/week
→ Give senior partners back 20 hours/month they're spending on admin

The question isn't whether AI will reshape your firm.

It's whether you'll be the one reshaping — or the one being reshaped.
