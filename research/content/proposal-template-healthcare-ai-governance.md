# AfrexAI — Healthcare AI Governance Implementation Proposal

## [CLIENT NAME] — AI Compliance & Governance Program

**Prepared by:** AfrexAI | ai-governance@afrexai.com
**Date:** [DATE]
**Valid for:** 30 days

---

## Executive Summary

[CLIENT NAME] uses AI across [clinical decision support / claims processing / revenue cycle / patient engagement — customize]. The HHS AI governance mandate (effective April 3, 2026) requires documented governance frameworks, bias monitoring, and transparency protocols for all healthcare AI systems.

AfrexAI delivers production-ready AI governance in **3 weeks, not 6 months** — at a fraction of what Big 4 consultants charge.

## The Regulatory Landscape

| Regulation | Deadline | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| HHS AI Governance Executive Order | April 3, 2026 | All HHS divisions must adopt AI practices |
| CMS AI Transparency Rule | Ongoing enforcement | Claims/billing AI must be explainable |
| State-level AI laws (CO, IL, CT) | Varies (2026) | Bias auditing, consumer notice requirements |
| Joint Commission AI Standards | 2026 survey cycle | Hospital accreditation now includes AI oversight |

**Risk of non-compliance:** Audit findings, reimbursement delays, accreditation risk, class-action exposure on bias claims.

## Proposed Engagement

### Phase 1: AI System Inventory & Risk Assessment (Week 1)
- Catalog all AI/ML systems in production and pipeline
- Classify by risk tier (clinical vs administrative vs operational)
- Map data flows, decision points, and human override mechanisms
- Deliverable: **AI System Registry + Risk Heat Map**

### Phase 2: Governance Framework Design (Week 2)
- Custom governance policy aligned to HHS requirements
- Bias monitoring protocols per system
- Incident response playbook for AI failures
- Deliverable: **AI Governance Policy Document + Monitoring Playbook**

### Phase 3: Implementation & Documentation (Week 3)
- Deploy automated monitoring dashboards
- Configure alerting for bias drift and model degradation
- Staff training materials and compliance documentation
- Deliverable: **Production monitoring + Compliance-ready documentation package**

### Ongoing Support (Optional — Month 2+)
- Monthly governance reviews and reporting
- Regulatory update monitoring (new rules, enforcement actions)
- Quarterly bias audits and model performance reviews
- Annual policy refresh

## Investment

| Component | Timeline | Investment |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1-3: Full Implementation | 3 weeks | $180,000 |
| Ongoing Monthly Support | Per month | $15,000/mo |
| Annual Governance Refresh | Yearly | $45,000 |

**Compare:** Big 4 consulting firms quote $500K-$1.2M for similar scope over 4-6 months. AfrexAI delivers in 3 weeks at 65-85% savings.

### ROI Justification
- **Avoided audit costs:** $200K-$500K per finding
- **Avoided reimbursement delays:** $50K-$150K/month during remediation
- **Avoided litigation exposure:** $1M+ per bias claim
- **Time to compliance:** 3 weeks vs 6 months = 5 months of reduced risk exposure
