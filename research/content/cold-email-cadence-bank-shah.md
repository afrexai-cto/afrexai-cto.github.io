# Cold Email Sequence — Cadence Bank (Viren Shah, CDIO)
*Created: 2026-02-15 09:26 GMT | Revenue Engine Run #28*

## Email 1: The Hook (Day 1)

**Subject:** Ivan Edwards is right about real-time redaction — but that's just the start

**Body:**

Viren,

Your team at Cadence is already talking about AI for compliance — Ivan Edwards' comments on real-time redaction caught my eye.

Here's what we're seeing with mid-market banks ($30B-$80B assets): the ones deploying AI agents for KYC screening and AML monitoring are cutting review times by 60-70% while catching more suspicious activity, not less.

We build and manage those AI agents. Not a platform you have to figure out — actual working systems, deployed in weeks.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough of what this looks like for a bank Cadence's size be worth your time?

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Ivan Edwards is right about real-time redaction — but that's just the start

**Body:**

Viren,

Quick follow-up with a concrete example.

One financial services client was spending 40+ hours/week on manual KYC document review. We deployed an AI agent that:
- Pre-screens applications against sanctions lists in real-time
- Flags anomalies for human review (not replacing, augmenting)
- Generates audit-ready documentation automatically

Result: 65% reduction in review time, zero missed flags in 6 months.

For Cadence at ~$50B assets, the compliance burden is only growing. Happy to show you exactly how this maps to your workflows.

Worth a quick call this week?

— Christina

## Email 3: The Break (Day 9)

**Subject:** closing the loop

**Body:**

Viren,

I'll keep this short — I know CDIOs don't have time for long emails.

If AI-powered compliance automation isn't a priority for Cadence right now, no worries at all. But if your team is evaluating this for 2026, I'd rather you see what's actually possible before committing to a platform that needs 6 months of configuration.

We deploy working AI agents in weeks, not quarters. Happy to prove it.

Either way — good luck with the digital transformation. Cadence is clearly headed in the right direction.
