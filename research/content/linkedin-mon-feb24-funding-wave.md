## "The Funding Wave Is Here. Are You Ready?"

---

$100M+ just poured into AI compliance for financial services in a single week.

Bretton AI raised $75M. Avantos closed $25M from Bessemer. Covecta landed a deployment deal with b1BANK.

Here's what that means for mid-market banks and credit unions:

Your competitors aren't "exploring AI" anymore. They're deploying autonomous agents for KYC, AML, and regulatory reporting. JPMorgan already has compliance agents in production.

The gap between "we're looking into it" and "we're live" is widening every quarter.

But here's the part nobody talks about: 95% of enterprise AI projects never make it past pilot. Not because the tech doesn't work — because implementation is where things break.

Data doesn't connect. Governance doesn't exist. The vendor disappears after deployment.

That's the real opportunity. Not another platform. Not another tool to learn.

An implementation partner who makes AI agents actually work inside your existing infrastructure — with governance built in from day one.

The market just told you this is real. The question is whether you'll be deploying or still evaluating when your board asks about AI next quarter.
