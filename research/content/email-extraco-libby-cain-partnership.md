**Subject:** Your 27% conversion lift caught our attention

Hi Libby,

I saw the CDP World session on what your team built at Extraco — unifying 44 data sources and driving a 27% conversion increase and $63.6M in added earning assets. That's not a pilot. That's proof.

We work with community banks deploying AI agents for operations beyond marketing — lending workflows, compliance screening, fraud detection. The banks we talk to keep asking the same question: "Has anyone actually done this?" Your results are the best answer we've seen.

Two things I wanted to float:

1. **Co-branded case study** — We'd write it, you'd approve it. Positions Extraco as the benchmark for community bank AI. No cost, no commitment.

2. **Operational AI expansion** — If your team is looking at AI agents for back-office operations (KYC, loan processing, customer service routing), that's exactly what we build. Happy to share what's working at other banks your size.

Either way, what your team pulled off deserves more visibility. Would a 15-minute call next week make sense?
