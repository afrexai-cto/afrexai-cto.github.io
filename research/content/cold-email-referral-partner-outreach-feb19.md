# Referral Partner Outreach — Email Sequence
*Created: 2026-02-19 18:57 GMT | Target: Boutique consultancies, IT integrators, fractional CTO firms*

## Why Partners First?
- 40% close rate (vs 3-5% cold email to end clients)
- Near-zero CAC — they bring warm intros
- 15% revenue share for 12 months = aligned incentives
- They already have the relationships we need

## Email 1 — Day 0: The Opening

**Subject A:** Quick question about your AI implementation clients
**Subject B:** Partnership idea — your clients, our AI agents
**Subject C:** Do your clients keep asking about AI?

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I came across {{company}} and noticed you work with {{vertical}} companies on digital transformation.

Quick question: are your clients asking about AI implementation but you don't have the bandwidth (or desire) to build custom AI agents in-house?

We're AfrexAI — we build and manage AI agent workforces for mid-market companies. Think of us as the implementation layer. Our sweet spot is firms spending $200K-$500K on AI but getting stuck at the pilot stage.

We're building a small referral network — 5 consultancies max — where you introduce us to clients who need AI agents, and we handle delivery. You get 15% of first-year revenue on every deal. On a typical $300K engagement, that's $45K for an introduction.

Interested in a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — Day 5: The Proof Point

**Subject:** Re: Partnership idea — quick case study

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my note last week. Wanted to share why this works:

One stat that keeps coming up in our conversations: 78% of enterprises are using AI now (Stanford AI Index 2025), but only 15-25% successfully scale past pilots. That gap is where we live.

Our typical engagement:
- Week 1: Working demo of AI agents customised to the client's workflow
- Month 2: Cash-flow positive for the client
- 70-90% gross margins for us (so the 15% share is sustainable)

The firms we partner with like it because they deepen client relationships without building an AI practice from scratch. We handle the technical delivery, you keep the advisory relationship.

Worth a quick chat?

Christina

## Email 3 — Day 12: The Urgency

**Subject:** Last thought on the AI partnership

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Last note on this — we're capping our partner network at 5 firms to keep quality high. Two spots are spoken for.

If your clients are in financial services, legal, or healthcare, the timing is especially good:
- HHS AI governance mandate hits April 3 (healthcare)
- 97% of general counsel report increased workload, only 39% using AI (legal)
- Basel III.1 and AML pressure driving finserv AI spend

Happy to do a no-commitment call to explore fit. If it's not right, no hard feelings.

## Target Partner Profiles

### Ideal Partners:
1. **Boutique management consultancies** (10-50 people) serving mid-market
2. **Fractional CTO/CIO firms** — they advise but don't build
3. **IT services firms** doing digital transformation but not AI-native
4. **Industry-specific consultancies** (healthcare ops, legal ops, fintech advisory)
5. **Accounting/advisory firms** with tech consulting arms

### Where to Find Them:
- LinkedIn: "digital transformation consultancy" + {{vertical}}
- Clutch.co: Top AI consulting firms (tier 2-3, not Big 4)
- Local tech meetups and accelerators
- Conference speaker lists (they're already thought leaders)
