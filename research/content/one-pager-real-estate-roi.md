# AI Agent ROI — Real Estate Operations
*For operators managing 10+ transactions/month*

---

## The Problem

| Task | Hours/Week | Agent Handles? |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Lead qualification & response | 8-12 | ✅ 24/7 instant |
| Transaction coordination emails | 5-8 | ✅ Automated |
| Document collection & follow-up | 3-5 | ✅ Tracked |
| Market comp research | 2-4 | ✅ On-demand |
| Compliance checklist tracking | 2-3 | ✅ Auto-monitored |
| **Total recoverable** | **20-32 hrs/wk** | |

## The Math

- **Your time value:** $150-300/hr (conservative for Miami market)
- **Recovered hours:** 20-32/week
- **Monthly value recovered:** $12,000 - $38,400
- **AfrexAI cost:** $750/mo (intro) → $1,500/mo (standard)
- **ROI:** 8x-25x in month one

## What You Get

1. **Dedicated AI agents** running on your own infrastructure (not shared)
2. **Custom-trained** on your criteria, market, and workflow
3. **Managed 24/7** — we handle updates, monitoring, and fixes
4. **Human-in-the-loop** — agents escalate to you, never act without your rules
5. **Weekly performance reports** — what the agents handled, time saved, leads processed

## Timeline

- **Day 1-3:** Discovery call + requirements
- **Day 4-7:** Agent deployment on dedicated server
- **Day 8-14:** Testing with live data, refinement
- **Day 15+:** Full autonomous operation with monitoring

## Proof

- **$111K pre-delivery payment** from our first enterprise client (legal sector) — before we wrote a line of code. That's how much trust our approach builds.
- **AfrexAI manages AI deployments** for regulated industries (legal, financial, healthcare). Real estate compliance is simpler — which means faster time-to-value for you.
