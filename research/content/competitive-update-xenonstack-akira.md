# Competitive Intel: XenonStack / Akira AI / ElixirData
**Date:** 2026-02-21

## Overview
XenonStack (xenonstack.com) is positioning two products as an agentic AI platform stack:
- **Akira AI** (akira.ai) — Cross-domain multi-agent orchestration, autonomous decisioning
- **ElixirData** (elixirdata.co) — Metadata-driven analytics, governed data intelligence

## Positioning
"Deploy coordinated autonomous agents that analyze, decide, and act — not just report."
Key claims: multi-agent orchestration, contextual reasoning, workflow integration, governed AI.

## Strengths
- Full-stack approach (analytics + action)
- Enterprise governance messaging
- Strong SEO/content play (detailed blog posts ranking for "agentic AI platforms 2026")

## Weaknesses
- Platform-dependent (you adopt THEIR stack)
- No managed service offering visible — it's software, not outcomes
- India-based — may face trust barriers with US mid-market compliance buyers
- No vertical specialization (finserv, healthcare, legal)

## Our Edge
- We sell outcomes, not platforms. Client doesn't learn new software.
- Vertical expertise (finserv compliance, healthcare governance, legal automation)
- Managed service = ongoing relationship, not one-time license
- Platform-agnostic = no vendor lock-in risk
- Human-in-the-loop governance vs their autonomous-first pitch

## Action Items
- Monitor their pricing (not publicly listed — likely enterprise sales)
- Track if they enter US mid-market
- Use their existence to validate market size in pitch decks ("even platform vendors are pivoting to agentic AI")
