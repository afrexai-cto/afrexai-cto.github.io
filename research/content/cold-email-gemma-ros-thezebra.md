# Cold Email Draft — Gemma Ros, CTO, TheZebra
*Draft for Gmail (ksmolichki@afrexai.com) — DO NOT SEND without approval*

## Subject: SB-205 and explainable recommendations

## Body:

Gemma,

Your point about trust depending on explainable decisions stuck with me. With Colorado's SB-205 taking effect, insurance comparison platforms are in an interesting spot — every recommendation could qualify as a "consequential decision" under the act.

We help companies like TheZebra build AI governance into their operations from the ground up. Not compliance theatre — actual audit trails, bias monitoring, and human oversight frameworks that satisfy regulators without slowing you down.

A few things we've been hearing from insurtech CTOs:
- "We know we need governance but don't know where to start"
- "Our AI decisions need to be explainable to regulators, not just engineers"
- "We can't afford to wait until enforcement starts"

If any of that resonates, I'd love to share what we've seen work. 15 minutes?

Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
