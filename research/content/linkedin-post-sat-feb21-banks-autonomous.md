Banks are quietly making the biggest AI shift since mobile banking.

Not chatbots. Not copilots. Autonomous agents that move money, manage compliance, and run treasury operations end-to-end.

PYMNTS just reported that banks and finance chiefs are deploying AI agents capable of orchestrating entire workflows across compliance and treasury — without a human in the loop for routine operations.

Meanwhile, 70% of community banks are still waiting for their core service provider to figure out AI for them.

Three things I'm watching:

1. The gap between banks building their own AI strategy vs. waiting for their CSP is becoming a competitive moat
2. Governance isn't optional anymore — NIST just launched the AI Agent Standards Initiative, and the OCC is watching
3. The winners aren't the banks with the most AI tools. They're the ones with 3-5 agents that actually work in production

The question isn't "should we adopt AI agents?"

It's "who's going to make sure they work in a regulated environment?"

That's the gap we close at AfrexAI.
