# LinkedIn Post: The 61% Gap
*Created: 2026-02-19 | Hook: Yesterday's GC Report data*

The FTI/Relativity General Counsel Report dropped yesterday.

One stat stopped me cold:

97% of General Counsel say their workload increased this year.
Only 39% are using AI to handle it.

That's not a technology gap. That's a survival gap.

And it gets worse — 57% are paying MORE for disputes and investigations. 30% saw increased regulatory activity. 70% brought up AI risk concerns unprompted.

They know AI is the answer. They're just scared of getting it wrong.

Which makes sense. Most "AI for legal" products are glorified search bars or chatbots that hallucinate case law.

But here's what's actually working right now:

→ AI agents that review contracts 85% faster than associates
→ Compliance screening that catches what humans miss at 3am
→ Document analysis that turns 40-hour reviews into 4-hour reviews

The firms in that 39% aren't experimenting. They're winning.

The 61% aren't cautious. They're falling behind.

Which side is your team on?
