## Email 1 — Day 1: The ABA Compliance Gap

**Subject:** {Company}'s AI tools may already violate ABA Model Rules

**Body:**

{FirstName},

Quick question — does {Company} have a formal AI governance policy that maps to ABA Model Rules 5.1 and 5.3?

Most firms don't. The ABA's Formal Opinion 512 made it clear: lawyers have a duty of competence (Rule 1.1) that now extends to understanding the AI tools their teams use. And supervisory obligations (Rules 5.1/5.3) mean managing partners are personally liable for AI misuse by associates and staff.

We've seen firms scrambling after the Mata v. Avianca fallout — but the real risk isn't hallucinated citations. It's client data leaking through unvetted AI tools. Rule 1.6 (confidentiality) has no carve-out for "we didn't know the associate was using ChatGPT."

At AfrexAI, we build AI governance frameworks specifically for law firms — audit trails, usage policies, and monitoring that map directly to ABA ethics obligations. Implementation takes 3 weeks, not 3 months.

Would a 15-minute call this week make sense? I can walk through what a compliant AI policy looks like for a firm {Company}'s size.

Best,

## Email 2 — Day 4: The Competitive Angle

**Subject:** Re: {Company}'s AI tools

**Body:**

{FirstName},

One thing I didn't mention — the Am Law 200 firms moving fastest on AI governance aren't doing it for compliance. They're doing it to win RFPs.

Corporate legal departments are starting to require AI governance documentation from outside counsel. We've seen RFP questions like:

- "Describe your firm's AI usage policy and client data protections"
- "What audit trails exist for AI-assisted work product?"
- "How do you ensure AI tools comply with privilege and confidentiality obligations?"

Firms without documented answers are losing bids to firms that have them. It's becoming a competitive differentiator, not just a risk checkbox.

Our governance framework gives you those answers — plus the actual infrastructure behind them. One client went from "no formal policy" to "RFP-ready AI governance" in 18 days.

Happy to share examples if useful.

## Email 3 — Day 9: The Graceful Exit with Value

**Subject:** Free resource — AI Ethics Compliance Checklist for Law Firms

**Body:**

{FirstName},

I know timing isn't always right, so I'll keep this brief.

We put together a one-page AI Ethics Compliance Checklist specifically for law firms — covers ABA Model Rules mapping, state bar requirements (30+ states now have AI-specific guidance), and the 5 policies every firm should have documented.

Here's the link: [AI Governance Checklist]

No strings attached. If {Company} ever needs help implementing any of it, we're here.

All the best,
{SenderName}
