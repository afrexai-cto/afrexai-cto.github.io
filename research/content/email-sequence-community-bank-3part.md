# 3-Part Email Sequence: Community Bank AI Implementation
*Using Extraco proof points + CSI survey data + NIST urgency*

## Email 1: The Proof Point
**Subject:** A $2.5B community bank just added $63.6M with AI agents
**Send timing:** Tuesday 9:30 AM EST

Hi [First Name],

Quick stat that might change your Q3 planning: Extraco Banks in Texas unified 44 data sources into an AI agent framework. Result — 27% campaign conversion lift and $63.6 million in added earning assets.

They're a $2.5 billion community bank. Not JPMorgan. Not a fintech startup. A community bank your size.

The CSI 2026 Banking Priorities Survey shows 27% of community bank leaders now rank AI as their #1 priority — above cybersecurity for the first time. But understanding the opportunity and capturing it are two different things.

We help banks like [Bank Name] go from "we should be doing something with AI" to deployed agents handling compliance, lending workflows, and customer intelligence. No 18-month roadmap. First agents live in 30 days.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

## Email 2: The Standards Clock (Day 5)
**Subject:** NIST just changed the AI timeline for banks
**Send timing:** Following Monday 10:00 AM EST

Hi [First Name],

Following up — NIST launched its AI Agent Standards Initiative last week. Three pillars: industry standards, interoperability protocols, and security/identity requirements.

This moves fast for federal. RFIs and guidelines are coming in months, not years.

For banks deploying AI agents without governance frameworks, this creates a real audit exposure. For banks who haven't started yet, the window to build compliant-from-day-one just got shorter.

We build AI agent deployments with governance baked in — not bolted on after the fact. Every agent we deploy comes with audit trails, human-in-the-loop controls, and compliance documentation.

If this is on your radar for 2026, I'd love to share how we're approaching it for other community banks.

## Email 3: The Competitor Move (Day 10)
**Subject:** Your competitors are hiring AI teams. There's a faster way.
**Send timing:** Following Friday 9:00 AM EST

Hi [First Name],

Last note on this. McKinsey claims they deployed 25,000 AI agents in under two years. EY's engineering chief says "a handful of agents do the heavy lifting." PwC's AI chief says agent count is "the wrong measure."

The takeaway: you don't need thousands of agents. You need 3-5 that actually work.

Community banks can't build what McKinsey built. But you don't need to. You need AI agents handling your highest-friction workflows — KYC screening, loan document processing, customer onboarding — governed and auditable from day one.

That's exactly what we deliver. First deployment in 30 days. No platform lock-in. Full governance from the start.

I'll leave it here. If AI operations are a 2026 priority for [Bank Name], reply and we'll set up 15 minutes.
