## Email 1 — "The CPA Shortage Isn't Going Away" (Day 1)

**Subject:** 300,000 CPAs short — and tax season just started

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Tax season is here and you already know the math: 300,000+ fewer CPAs in the US workforce than a decade ago, and the pipeline isn't recovering.

Most firms are handling this the same way — longer hours, more overtime, delayed advisory work. That buys another season. Maybe two.

We work with mid-market firms that took a different approach: AI agents handling the repetitive compliance and prep work so their senior staff can focus on advisory — which is where the margins actually are.

One firm cut audit prep time by 40% in the first quarter. Not by replacing anyone. By giving their team agents that handle document collection, cross-referencing, and first-pass review automatically.

If you're open to a 30-minute conversation about what that looks like for [Company], our CEO Christina Beckford would love to connect:

## Email 2 — "Your Advisory Gap Is a Revenue Gap" (Day 5)

**Subject:** Quick follow-up — the advisory revenue you're leaving on the table

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note earlier this week.

Here's the pattern we see at firms your size: compliance work eats 60-70% of senior staff time. Advisory services — the work clients actually pay premium rates for — gets squeezed into whatever's left.

The firms pulling ahead in 2026 aren't hiring their way out of this. They're deploying AI agents for:

- Automated document intake and classification
- Tax return prep and cross-reference checks
- Audit workpaper assembly
- Client communication triage
- Regulatory change monitoring (think: new FASB standards, state tax law changes)

That frees up 15-20 hours per senior accountant per week. At $300/hr advisory rates, the math is hard to ignore.

Worth a quick call to see if this fits your firm's situation?

## Email 3 — "Your Competitors Are Already Moving" (Day 10)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]'s AI plans

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Last note — I know you're deep in busy season.

Quick data point: the AICPA's 2026 survey shows 41% of mid-market accounting firms have started AI pilots. Most are stuck there — pilots that don't scale, tools that don't integrate with their existing workflow.

That's where we come in. We don't sell software. We deploy and manage AI agent workforces that plug into your existing systems — then we run them for you. Fixed monthly cost, no hiring, no IT overhead.

Starting at $1,500/month for a single managed agent. Most firms see ROI within 60 days.

If this isn't a priority right now, no worries at all. But if you're evaluating options for after busy season, a 30-minute call now means you're ready to deploy in Q2:
