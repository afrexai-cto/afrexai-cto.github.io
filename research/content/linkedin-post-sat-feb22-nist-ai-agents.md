# LinkedIn Post — NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative
*Draft: Feb 21, 2026 | For AfrexAI company page | Saturday PM posting*

NIST just launched the "AI Agent Standards Initiative."

That's the U.S. government saying: AI agents aren't experimental anymore. They need standards. They need governance. They need to work securely and interoperably across systems.

Three pillars they're building on:
→ Industry-led agent standards
→ Open source protocols for agent interoperability  
→ Security and identity research for trusted adoption

Here's what this means for enterprises:

The window between "we should explore AI agents" and "we need governed, standards-compliant AI agents" just got very small.

If your AI implementation doesn't have governance baked in from day one, you're building technical debt that will cost 10x to fix when these standards drop.

At AfrexAI, we've been building managed AI workforces with governance built in since the start — not because we predicted NIST would move this fast, but because regulated industries demanded it.

The firms that treat AI governance as an afterthought will be scrambling. The ones that built it in? They'll be compliant before the standards are even finalized.

Which camp are you in?
