### Email 1: The Certification Window
**Subject:** Joint Commission AI certification is coming — are you ready?

Hi {{first_name}},

The Joint Commission and CHAI are rolling out voluntary AI certification for health systems in 2026. The organizations that certify early will set the standard. The ones that scramble later will pay 3x more.

Most health systems we talk to have 15-30 AI tools already deployed — but no unified governance framework. That's the gap regulators are targeting.

We help mid-market health systems build AI governance infrastructure that passes certification on the first attempt. Our clients typically go from fragmented AI usage to certified governance in 8-12 weeks.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this applies to {{org_name}}?

Best,
AfrexAI Team

### Email 2: The Compliance Cost (Day +3)
**Subject:** Re: Joint Commission AI certification is coming

{{first_name}},

Quick data point — Wolters Kluwer's 2026 healthcare AI report flagged that compliance teams are now being pulled into C-suite strategy. That's new. It means the cost of AI non-compliance is shifting from "IT problem" to "board-level liability."

Colorado SB 205 (effective Feb 2026) is the template. Other states are following. Health systems operating across state lines face a patchwork — and unified governance is the only scalable answer.

We built a framework that handles multi-state AI compliance from a single dashboard. One of our clients went from 3 FTEs managing AI audits to automated compliance reporting in 6 weeks.

Happy to share the case study if useful.

### Email 3: The Peer Proof (Day +7)
**Subject:** How {{similar_org}} handled this

{{first_name}},

Last follow-up. Just wanted to share — we recently worked with a {{bed_count}}-bed system facing the exact same challenge: dozens of AI tools, no centralized governance, and the Joint Commission certification deadline approaching.

Result: Full AI inventory, risk scoring, and governance framework deployed in 10 weeks. They're now positioned as a reference site for the certification program.

If AI governance is on your 2026 roadmap, I'd love to compare notes. If not, no worries — timing matters.
