Subject: Guest pitch — $111K pre-delivery for AI automation (real numbers, not hype)

Hi [Host],

Love what you're doing with [Podcast Name] — especially the episode on [specific episode].

I'm Christina Beckford, CEO of AfrexAI. We build AI agent systems for legal, financial services, and healthcare companies. Not chatbots — full workflow automation that replaces 40+ hours of manual work per week.

Our first client paid $111K upfront before we delivered a single feature. That's how obvious the ROI was.

I'd love to share:
- Why most AI projects fail (and the 3 things that make ours stick)
- How mid-market companies are quietly saving $200K+/year with agent automation
- The "Week I Win" framework — delivering a working demo in 7 days flat

Happy to do 30–60 minutes, whatever works for your format.

Christina
CEO, AfrexAI
