# AI Agents for Accounting & Advisory Firms
*AfrexAI — Managed AI Workforce for Mid-Market Professional Services*

---

## The Problem

Mid-market accounting firms (50-500 staff) are squeezed:

- **Tax season burnout**: 70+ hour weeks for 4 months straight. Staff attrition at 30%+ annually.
- **Audit documentation**: 40-60 hours per engagement on workpaper prep alone.
- **Advisory gap**: Partners want to shift from compliance to advisory, but compliance work consumes 80% of capacity.
- **Talent crisis**: AICPA reports 300,000+ CPA shortage by 2026. Pipeline shrinking 33% since 2020.
- **AI tools, no strategy**: Firms buy software but lack implementation expertise. 95% of AI projects fail to reach production (MIT).

## What We Deploy

Managed AI agents that run inside your firm — not another SaaS login.

| Agent | What It Does | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Audit Prep Agent** | Pulls PBC lists, maps to workpapers, flags missing items | 60% reduction in prep time |
| **Tax Research Agent** | Monitors IRC changes, case law, state nexus rules — surfaces relevant updates | 4-8 hrs/week saved per senior |
| **Client Intake Agent** | Processes engagement letters, conflict checks, onboarding docs | Same-day onboarding vs. 2-week average |
| **Advisory Signal Agent** | Analyzes client financials for advisory opportunities (R&D credits, cost seg, entity restructuring) | 15-25% revenue lift from existing clients |
| **Compliance Monitor** | Tracks filing deadlines, peer review requirements, CPE hours | Zero missed deadlines |

## Why Not Just Buy Software?

Software gives you features. We give you outcomes.

- **Governance built in**: Every agent has audit trails, human-in-the-loop controls, and data residency compliance.
- **Your data stays yours**: On-premise or private cloud. No training on your client data.
- **We run it**: Our team manages deployment, updates, monitoring. Your team uses it.
- **NIST-aligned**: Built to the AI Agent Standards Initiative framework (Feb 2026).

## Pricing

| Package | What's Included | Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| Single Agent | 1 managed agent + governance + support | $1,500/mo |
| Firm Swarm | 3-5 agents + orchestration + priority support | $5,000/mo |
| Enterprise | Custom agent workforce + dedicated account team | Custom |

**Intro offer**: $750 first month. No long-term contract required.

## The Math

A firm with 200 staff spending $180/hr average:
- 10 hrs/week saved per professional × 50 professionals = 500 hrs/month
- 500 × $180 = **$90,000/month in recovered capacity**
- Investment: $5,000/month → **18x ROI**
