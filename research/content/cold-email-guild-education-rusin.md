# Cold Email — Guild Education (Jessica Rusin, CTO)

## Angle: Colorado SB 24-205 + EdTech AI Compliance

### Email 1 — Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Guild's AI matching algorithms — SB 24-205 ready?

**Body:**

Jessica,

Guild's AI-powered career matching is exactly the kind of model Colorado's SB 24-205 targets — algorithmic decision-making that affects employment and education outcomes.

The tricky part isn't building the bias tests. It's documenting them in a way that satisfies regulators while your team keeps shipping. Most companies I've seen either over-engineer it (6 months, $500K) or under-invest and get caught flat-footed.

We built a 3-week framework that handles bias auditing, model documentation, and ongoing monitoring for companies using AI in high-stakes decisions. Specifically designed for Colorado-based tech companies navigating SB 24-205.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

### Email 2 — Follow-up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Guild's AI matching algorithms

Jessica,

Following up — one thing I didn't mention: the April 2026 HHS AI governance mandate is creating compliance patterns that Colorado regulators are actively adopting. Companies that get ahead of it now avoid the scramble later.

Happy to share our Colorado SB 24-205 compliance guide (free, no strings) if it's useful for Guild's team.

### Email 3 — Break-up (Day 10)

**Subject:** Re: closing the loop
