*Created: 2026-02-20 16:57 GMT | Trigger: Treasury press release Feb 18*

## Hook
U.S. Treasury just released the Financial Services AI Risk Management Framework (FS AI RMF) + AI Lexicon on Feb 18, 2026. This is the first federal-level practical AI governance framework specifically for financial services. Every bank, insurer, and wealth manager now has a compliance baseline to meet.

## Target Buyer
- Chief Risk Officers (CROs), Chief Compliance Officers (CCOs), Chief AI Officers at mid-market financial institutions ($500M-$5B)
- Also: Heads of Technology, CIOs at community banks and regional banks

## Email 1 — Day 0: "Treasury just changed the AI compliance clock"

**Subject options:**
- Treasury's new AI framework — is your team ready?
- The FS AI RMF just dropped. Here's what it means for [Company].
- Feb 18 changed AI compliance for every financial institution

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Two days ago, the U.S. Treasury released something that flew under most radars: the Financial Services AI Risk Management Framework and a standardized AI Lexicon.

For the first time, there's a federal-level practical framework specifically for how financial institutions should govern AI. Not aspirational guidance — actual risk management tools with common definitions regulators will expect you to use.

This matters because:
- OCC, SEC, and state regulators will align to this framework
- Inconsistent AI terminology across your teams is now a governance gap
- Every AI tool your firm uses — from fraud detection to customer engagement — needs to map to this framework

Most mid-market firms I talk to have AI deployed in 3-5 functions but zero governance framework tying them together. That gap just became visible to regulators.

We help financial institutions implement AI governance that actually works — not 200-page policy docs, but working frameworks your compliance team can audit against.

Worth a 15-minute call to see where [Company] stands relative to the FS AI RMF?

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Email 2 — Day 5: "The 3 gaps Treasury's framework exposes"

**Subject:** 3 things most banks get wrong about AI governance

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up on Treasury's new FS AI RMF — after reviewing the framework in detail, three gaps show up at almost every mid-market institution:

1. **No common AI language** — Legal, compliance, and tech teams literally use different definitions for the same AI concepts. Treasury's Lexicon exists because this problem is universal.

2. **AI deployed without risk classification** — Most firms have AI in production (fraud, underwriting, customer service) but haven't classified those systems by risk tier. The framework requires it.

3. **No incident response for AI failures** — When an AI model produces a biased lending decision or a hallucinated compliance report, most firms have no playbook. Regulators will ask.

We built a 90-day AI governance implementation that addresses all three. Our clients go from "we use AI" to "we govern AI" — with documentation regulators actually accept.

Happy to share how a similar-sized institution handled this. Free to chat this week?

## Email 3 — Day 12: "Before your next board meeting"

**Subject:** AI governance before the board asks

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

One last thought — boards are starting to ask management teams pointed questions about AI governance. "What's our AI risk framework?" is becoming as common as "What's our cyber posture?"

Treasury's FS AI RMF gives boards a benchmark to measure against. The firms that get ahead of this conversation — rather than scrambling to answer it — are the ones that keep board confidence.

We've helped institutions prepare board-ready AI governance packages in under 60 days. If that's relevant, I'd welcome a brief conversation.

Either way, hope the framework context was useful.
