**Subject:** Nationwide's 90% AI adoption target — the implementation gap

**Body:**

Jim,

Saw the Fortune piece on Nationwide's $1.5B tech commitment and the 90% AI adoption target by end of 2026. Ambitious — and exactly the kind of bet that separates mutuals that thrive from ones that get acquired.

Here's what we're seeing with carriers at similar scale: Copilot gets you the first 50%. The jump from 50% to 90% requires purpose-built AI agents for specific workflows — claims triage, underwriting assist, policyholder service — not general-purpose copilots.

We build and manage those agents. One P&C carrier we worked with cut claims processing time by 43% and reduced E&O exposure by building governance controls directly into the agent workflow. No hallucination risk because the agents are constrained to verified data sources and company policy.

Given Nationwide's scale (22,000 employees, 46 states), even a 1% efficiency gain in claims or underwriting translates to tens of millions. We typically prove that out in a 6-week pilot on a single line of business.

Worth a conversation?

Best,

## Notes
- Jim Fowler is the decision-maker for all tech strategy
- Nationwide is a mutual — no quarterly earnings pressure, can invest long-term
- The 50%→90% gap is a real problem — Copilot ≠ domain-specific agents
- Computer vision/digital twins angle is secondary hook for follow-up
- **Do NOT send without explicit approval**
