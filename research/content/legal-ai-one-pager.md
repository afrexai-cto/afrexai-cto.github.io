# Stop Billing for Work AI Should Be Doing

## AfrexAI — AI Agents for Law Firms That Actually Work

---

### The Problem

Your attorneys spend **40-60% of their time** on tasks AI can handle: contract review, due diligence, document analysis, compliance checks. That's $200K+ per attorney per year on work that doesn't require a law degree.

Meanwhile, your competitors are deploying AI agents that review contracts in minutes, not days.

### What We Do

We build, deploy, and manage **autonomous AI agents** purpose-built for your firm's workflows:

**Contract Review Agent** — Analyzes agreements against your playbook. Flags deviations, suggests redlines, learns your standards. 85%+ accuracy on first pass.

**Due Diligence Agent** — Processes data rooms in hours, not weeks. Identifies risks, creates summaries, builds issue lists your associates would take days to produce.

**Compliance Monitoring Agent** — Tracks regulatory changes across jurisdictions. Alerts partners to relevant updates. Drafts client advisories.

**Knowledge Management Agent** — Searches your precedent database, surfaces relevant work product, eliminates the "we've done this before" problem.

### Why Firms Choose Us Over DIY

| | DIY / ChatGPT | AfrexAI |
|---|---|---|
| Setup time | 6-12 months | 7 days to first demo |
| Data security | Your data trains their models | Private, on-premise option |
| Customization | Generic prompts | Trained on YOUR playbook |
| Maintenance | Your IT team (good luck) | Fully managed, 24/7 |
| ROI timeline | Unknown | Measurable in 90 days |

### The Numbers

- **3,000+ AI prompts/day** — what leading firms already process (Shook Hardy & Bacon)
- **$60M saved** — what Klarna achieved replacing manual work with AI agents
- **2-4 month** typical deployment cycle for law firms
- **40% of AI projects fail** without proper implementation (Gartner 2026) — we're the insurance policy
