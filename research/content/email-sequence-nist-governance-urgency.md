# Email Sequence: NIST AI Agent Standards — Governance Urgency

## Email 1 — Day 0: The Standards Are Coming

**Subject:** NIST just made AI agent governance mandatory (practically)

Hi [First Name],

On February 20th, NIST launched the AI Agent Standards Initiative — a federal program to establish security, interoperability, and governance standards for AI agents.

This isn't a think tank whitepaper. It's NIST. Guidelines, RFIs, and compliance frameworks are coming in months, not years.

For [Company], this means every AI agent deployment you're running (or planning) will need to meet standards for:
- Security and identity management
- Interoperability across systems
- Governance and auditability

The companies building governance into their AI implementations now will be compliant before the ink dries. The ones retrofitting? That's a 6-figure remediation project.

We help mid-market firms deploy AI agents with governance built in from day one. Not bolted on after the fact.

Worth a 20-minute conversation about where [Company] stands?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — Day 5: The Cost of Waiting

**Subject:** Re: NIST just made AI agent governance mandatory (practically)

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up — since I last wrote, two things happened:

1. NIST confirmed they'll be issuing RFIs and hosting listening sessions in the coming months
2. Three more enterprises we work with accelerated their governance timelines

The pattern is clear: the firms that move first set the standard. The ones that wait inherit someone else's framework and pay to retrofit.

Our governance-first approach means your AI agents are auditable, secure, and standards-ready from deployment. No rework when NIST publishes guidelines.

Happy to share how we've structured this for firms in [Industry]. 20 minutes — that's all I need.

Best,
Christina

## Email 3 — Day 12: Quick Question

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]'s AI governance

Hi [First Name],

Last one from me on this.

Simple question: if NIST published AI agent governance standards tomorrow, would [Company]'s current AI deployments pass?

If the answer isn't an immediate "yes" — that's exactly the gap we close.

We've helped firms in financial services, healthcare, and legal get governance-ready in weeks, not quarters.

Open to a brief call this week?
