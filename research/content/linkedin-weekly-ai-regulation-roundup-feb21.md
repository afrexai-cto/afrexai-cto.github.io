3 AI regulations dropped this week.

Most firms won't notice until it's too late.

Here's the 60-second version:

📋 U.S. Treasury released the FIRST federal AI Risk Management Framework for financial services. Not guidance — a framework. With teeth.

🏥 The HHS April 3 deadline is now 6 weeks away. Every division must adopt AI governance: bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, human oversight. If your health system hasn't started, you're already behind.

🌏 Singapore named legal as one of the FIRST professions requiring AI transition support. 400% tax deductions for AI tools. Government-funded AI Champions programme.

The pattern?

Regulators aren't asking IF you'll implement AI governance.

They're setting deadlines for WHEN.

The 15% of firms that successfully scale AI (Stanford HAI, 2025) all share one trait: they built governance INTO their implementation, not on top of it.

The other 85%? Retrofitting is 3-4x more expensive than doing it right the first time.

Which camp are you in?
