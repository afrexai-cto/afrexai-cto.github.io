## Subject: Quick question about TIFIN's internal AI ops

## Body:

Hi Stacy,

Congrats on the COO role at TIFIN — joining during a growth phase like this is exciting (and probably a bit chaotic).

Here's what got me thinking about you: TIFIN builds AI products for wealth managers, but as you scale across TIFIN AG, Magnifi, and TIFIN.AI — who's handling the internal operational AI? Document processing, compliance workflows, client onboarding across business units?

We work with mid-market fintechs to deploy managed AI agents for exactly that kind of operational overhead. Not another platform to manage — actual working agents that handle the repetitive stuff your team shouldn't be doing manually.

One of our fintech clients saved 40+ hours/week on compliance document processing within the first month.

Would a 15-minute call this week or next make sense? Happy to share what we're seeing work across wealthtech specifically.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
