## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your AI agents have more access than your employees

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: do you know how many AI agents are running inside your org right now?

Teleport just published research showing 69% of infrastructure leaders say AI adoption requires major changes to identity management. Okta launched a tool specifically to detect "shadow AI agents" — unauthorized AI accessing systems via OAuth.

The pattern we're seeing across [industry]: teams deploy AI agents for productivity, but nobody owns the security model. Static credentials. No audit trail. Agents with standing privileges they don't need.

We help regulated enterprises like [company] deploy AI agents with proper identity governance from day one — ephemeral credentials, zero standing privileges, full audit trails.

Would a 15-minute call to compare notes make sense this week?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Your AI agents have more access than your employees

[First Name],

One stat that keeps coming up in our conversations with [industry] security teams:

Gartner predicts 40%+ of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027 — and security failures are the #1 reason.

The companies avoiding this are treating AI agents like employees: identity verification, least-privilege access, behavioral monitoring, and offboarding when they're done.

We've built this exact framework for [similar company type]. Happy to share the playbook — no pitch, just the architecture.

## Email 3: The Close (Day 9)

**Subject:** AI agent governance checklist (free)

[First Name],

I put together a quick checklist based on what we're seeing work across regulated enterprises deploying AI agents:

1. Agent identity registry (who deployed what, when)
2. Ephemeral credentials (no hardcoded secrets)
3. Behavioral monitoring (what is the agent actually doing?)
4. Scope enforcement (agents only access what they need)
5. Kill switch (can you shut down a rogue agent in <60 seconds?)

Most teams we talk to score 1-2 out of 5. Where does [company] land?

If this resonates, I'd love to share how we help close the gaps — typically in 3-4 weeks.

## Notes
- Personalize [industry] and [company] for each target
- Pair with CISO prospect list in `prospects/ciso-ai-governance-targets.md`
- This sequence works for both outbound cold AND warm follow-ups from conference leads
- Key differentiator: we're not selling security tools, we're selling secure AI implementation
