## Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Quick question about your AI implementation clients

Hey [First Name],

I came across [Firm Name] — love what you're doing with [specific thing: digital transformation / ops consulting / tech advisory].

Quick thought: we build and manage AI agent workforces for mid-market enterprises. Think autonomous compliance screening, document processing, claims automation — not chatbots, actual working systems.

Our clients are typically $500M-$5B companies in financial services, legal, and healthcare. Average engagement is $200K-$350K.

Here's the thing — we don't do strategy consulting. You do. So when your clients say "great strategy, now who builds it?" — that's us.

Would a referral arrangement make sense? We pay 15% of first-year revenue for qualified introductions. On a typical deal, that's $30K-$50K per referral.

Worth a 15-minute call this week?

## Email 2: Follow-up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your AI implementation clients

[First Name] — just bumping this up.

One data point: 100% of enterprises plan to expand agentic AI in 2026 (CrewAI/BusinessWire, Feb 11). Your clients are going to ask about implementation. When they do, we want you to have a great answer.

Happy to send our partner deck or jump on a quick call.

## Email 3: Value-add (Day 10)

**Subject:** Thought you'd find this useful

[First Name],

Pulled together some numbers your clients might care about:

- McKinsey deployed 25,000 AI agents in <2 years — EY's response: "quality over quantity" matters more
- Gartner says 40%+ of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027
- The firms that succeed use managed implementation partners (HBR/Google Cloud, Feb 2026)

We wrote a short breakdown on what separates successful AI agent deployments from the 40% that fail. Want me to send it over?

Either way — if any of your clients mention AI agents, think of us. The referral commission is real.
