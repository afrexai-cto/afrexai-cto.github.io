## Email 1 — Day 0

**Subject:** AI governance for coastal carriers — before regulators ask

Ernesto,

Coastal P&C carriers are using AI more aggressively than anyone — catastrophe modeling, dynamic pricing, claims triage after storms. That's also why regulators are watching you more closely.

Florida's OIR is following the NAIC Model Bulletin closely. When they start requesting AI governance documentation (not if — when), carriers using AI in pricing and claims will be first in line.

We help carriers document, audit, and govern their AI usage across the full policy lifecycle — typically in 3 weeks. Heritage's exposure to cat-risk AI models makes this particularly relevant.

Worth a quick conversation before hurricane season planning kicks in?

**Subject:** Re: AI governance for coastal carriers

Follow-up with something concrete — our insurance AI compliance ROI calculator shows coastal carriers Heritage's size typically carry $3-5M in undocumented regulatory exposure from AI models alone.

The gap is usually in cat modeling and automated claims triage — areas where the AI is making decisions regulators consider "high impact."

## Email 3 — Day 7

**Subject:** Florida AI regulation timeline

Ernesto — quick intel. Colorado's already enforcing AI governance requirements for insurers. Florida OIR has been in NAIC working groups on the same framework since 2024.

Carriers that get ahead of this avoid the scramble. The ones that wait end up paying 3-5x more to retrofit compliance after enforcement starts.

Happy to share our Florida-specific regulatory timeline if useful.

## Email 4 — Day 14

**Subject:** Closing the loop

Ernesto — sounds like timing may not be right. No more emails from me.

When AI governance hits Heritage's priority list (likely when Florida OIR formalizes their framework), we're at afrexai.com.
