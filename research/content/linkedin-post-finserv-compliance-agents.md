Banks are hiring compliance teams faster than they can train them.

And it's still not enough.

Between Basel III.1, updated AML screening requirements, and SEC's new AI disclosure rules — the regulatory surface area is growing 3x faster than headcount.

Here's what we're seeing with financial services clients:

→ KYC screening that took 45 minutes now takes 6
→ Regulatory change monitoring that used to miss updates... doesn't
→ SAR filing prep that required 3 analysts now needs 1 (with an AI agent doing the heavy lifting)

The pattern isn't "replace compliance teams." It's "give your best people agents that handle the repetitive 80% so they focus on judgment calls."

One mid-market bank told us: "We don't need more analysts. We need our analysts to stop drowning in false positives."

That's the real ROI of AI in compliance. Not headcount reduction. Headcount liberation.

If your compliance team is still manually screening every alert, you're not just slow — you're exposed.

Happy to share how we're building this for firms like yours. DM or comment "compliance" below.
