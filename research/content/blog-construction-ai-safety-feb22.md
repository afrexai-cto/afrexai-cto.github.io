Something weird is happening in construction.

The industry that still runs on paper timesheets and faxed RFIs is suddenly posting "AI Officer" roles on LinkedIn.

Not tech companies. Construction firms. The ones pouring concrete and managing crane schedules.

Why now?

## OSHA's AI Position Statement Changed Everything

In late 2025, OSHA issued updated guidance on AI-assisted safety monitoring. The short version: if you use AI to make safety decisions on job sites, you need documentation that proves a human reviewed those decisions.

That sounds simple. It isn't.

Most construction firms using AI for safety — predictive incident analytics, computer vision for PPE compliance, automated inspection routing — deployed these tools without governance frameworks. The AI vendor said "plug and play." Nobody asked about audit trails.

Now OSHA is asking. And the answers aren't there.

## The Three Gaps Nobody Talks About

**1. Decision attribution**
When an AI system flags a safety risk and a foreman acts on it, who made the decision? The AI? The foreman? The safety director who approved the system? Construction firms need clear chains of accountability. Most have none.

**2. Training documentation**
AI systems that monitor job sites need to be trained on your specific conditions. Different soil types, different weather patterns, different equipment configurations. If your AI vendor trained the model on California data and you're building in Michigan, that's a compliance gap.

**3. Override protocols**
What happens when the AI says "stop work" but the project manager overrides it? Is that logged? Is there a review process? Most firms have verbal overrides with zero documentation.

## What Smart Firms Are Doing

The construction companies getting ahead of this aren't hiring armies of data scientists. They're doing three things:

**Documenting what they already have.** Most firms using AI don't even have a complete inventory of where AI touches their operations. Step one is just knowing what you've got.

**Building simple governance frameworks.** Not 200-page policies. One-page decision trees. Who approves AI deployment? Who reviews outputs? Who handles incidents? Simple, enforceable, auditable.

**Running readiness assessments.** Before OSHA comes knocking, they're scoring themselves across the dimensions regulators care about. Risk classification, human oversight, bias testing, incident response.

## The Window Is Closing

Construction margins are thin enough without compliance fines. The firms that build AI governance now — while it's still voluntary best practice — will have a massive advantage when it becomes mandatory.

And based on the regulatory trajectory, "mandatory" is months away, not years.
