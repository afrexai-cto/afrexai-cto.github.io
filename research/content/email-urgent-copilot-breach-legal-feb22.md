Subject: Microsoft's AI just read your confidential emails

Hi [First Name],

Last month, a bug in Microsoft 365 Copilot allowed the AI assistant to read and summarize emails explicitly labeled as confidential — including privileged client communications in Drafts and Sent Items.

The bug went undetected for four weeks. Microsoft won't say how many firms were affected.

For any firm using Microsoft 365 (which is most of them), this raises immediate questions:

- Were any privileged communications exposed to Copilot during that window?
- Do your DLP policies actually work across all M365 applications? (Microsoft's own docs say sensitivity labels don't behave consistently.)
- Could you demonstrate to a regulator that appropriate safeguards were in place?

This isn't hypothetical. It happened. And it's exactly the kind of governance gap that NIST's new AI Agent Standards Initiative is designed to address.

At AfrexAI, we help mid-size firms implement AI with governance built in from day one — not bolted on after a breach. Our managed approach means your AI deployments are auditable, compliant, and actually respect privilege boundaries.

If you'd like to discuss how your firm is positioned, our CEO Christina Beckford has time this week: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
The AfrexAI Team
