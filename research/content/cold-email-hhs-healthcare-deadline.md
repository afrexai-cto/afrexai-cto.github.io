# Cold Email: HHS AI Governance Deadline (April 3, 2026)
*Target: Healthcare orgs — hospitals, health systems, payers*
*Created: 2026-02-15*

## Version A — Urgency

**Subject:** 47 days until the HHS AI governance deadline

Hi {{first_name}},

April 3, 2026. That's when HHS requires all divisions to have AI governance practices in place — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security controls, human oversight.

Most healthcare orgs I've talked to are still figuring out what that even means operationally.

We built AI agents that handle the hard parts: automated bias audits, continuous outcome monitoring, security logging, and human-in-the-loop workflows — all mapped to the HHS framework.

The organizations moving fastest are getting compliant AND getting productivity gains at the same time. No reason governance has to be pure overhead.

Would it be useful to see how one health system got compliant in 3 weeks? Happy to share the case study.

## Version B — Educational

**Subject:** HHS AI mandate — what compliance teams are actually doing

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick note on the April 3 HHS AI governance deadline. We've been tracking how healthcare orgs are responding, and there's a clear split:

**Group A** is buying expensive GRC platforms and hoping the checkboxes cover them.

**Group B** is building lightweight AI governance agents that actually monitor their systems in real time — bias detection, outcome tracking, audit trails — for a fraction of the cost.

Group B is finishing in weeks, not months.

Happy to share the playbook we've put together if your team is navigating this. No strings.
