# LinkedIn Post — Insurtech AI Compliance (AfrexAI Company Page)

---

Insurance carriers are scaling AI into production in 2026. Claims automation, underwriting models, fraud detection — all going live.

But here's what most are missing:

Colorado's SB 24-205 requires bias testing and documentation for ANY AI model making insurance decisions. And it's not just Colorado — state regulators nationwide are watching.

The carriers who get compliance infrastructure right NOW will move fastest. The ones who treat it as an afterthought will hit a wall mid-deployment.

3 things every insurtech CTO should have in place before scaling:

→ Automated bias auditing that runs with every model update
→ Documentation that satisfies both the Division of Insurance AND the AG's office
→ Continuous monitoring that doesn't require a dedicated compliance team

We've been helping fintechs and insurtechs get this done in 3 weeks. Not 6 months. Not $1M in consulting fees.

If you're scaling AI in insurance and want the compliance checklist, drop a comment or DM.
