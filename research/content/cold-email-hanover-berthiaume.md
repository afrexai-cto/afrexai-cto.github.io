**Subject:** Hanover's innovation agenda + CT SB-2 compliance (quick question)

**Body:**

Mark,

Your dual CIO/Chief Technology Innovation Officer title caught my eye — most carriers separate those roles. Tells me Hanover's serious about making technology decisions that actually move the business, not just keep the lights on.

Quick question: as you're deploying AI across underwriting and claims (I saw the architecture-with-optionality approach Will Lee built), how are you handling the compliance layer? CT SB-2 is live, Colorado SB21-169 has teeth, and the NAIC Model Bulletin is becoming the de facto standard.

We built an AI governance automation platform that maps every model deployment to the applicable regulatory requirement — CT, CO, NAIC, state-by-state. One carrier cut their compliance review cycle from 14 weeks to 3.

I put together a 2-page AI Governance Framework specifically for P&C carriers navigating this. Happy to send it over if useful.

Best,
[AfrexAI signature]

**Follow-up (Day 5):**

Mark — attached the 2-page framework I mentioned. Page 2 has a 90-day implementation sprint that maps to NAIC Model Bulletin requirements. Curious if it aligns with how Hanover's thinking about this.

**Notes:**
- Reference Will Lee (former CIO) shows homework — but Berthiaume is current, don't overdo it
- "Technology Innovation Officer" angle differentiates from other insurance cold emails
- Independent agent model = data flows across thousands of agencies = compliance nightmare = our sweet spot
