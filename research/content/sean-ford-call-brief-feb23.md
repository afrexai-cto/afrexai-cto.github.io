# Sean Ford — Pre-Call Briefing (Feb 23, 15:00 GMT / 10:00 EST)

## Prospect Summary
- **Name:** Sean Ford
- **Company:** Skilled Real Estate, Miami FL
- **ICP Score:** 9/10 — INBOUND lead (agent setup wizard)
- **Source:** Downloaded agent configs from wizard
- **8 Automation Areas Identified:** Lead qualification, transaction coordination, listing management, market analysis, client follow-up, document preparation, showing scheduling, CRM updates

## What He Already Has
- Downloaded our agent config files from the setup wizard
- Received Christina's intro email (Feb 22) with $750 intro month offer
- Has NOT yet booked a Calendly call (as of last check)

## Call Objective
**Close him on $750 first month → $5,500/mo ongoing**

## Talking Points (Priority Order)

### 1. Start with HIS pain
"Which of the 8 areas you flagged is eating the most hours?"
- Most likely: lead qualification or transaction coordination
- Let him talk. Mirror his language back.

### 2. Show the math
- Average Miami RE agent spends 15-20 hrs/week on admin tasks
- Lead qualification agent: handles inquiries 24/7, qualifies against his criteria
- Conservative estimate: saves 10-15 hrs/week = $500-750/week in time value
- $750/mo intro = pays for itself in WEEK ONE

### 3. How it works (keep simple)
- We deploy agents on a dedicated server (his data, isolated)
- Agents connect to his existing tools (CRM, email, phone)
- We manage everything — updates, monitoring, optimization
- He tells us what "qualified" looks like, agents handle the rest
- Human-in-the-loop: agents flag, he decides

### 4. Handle objections
| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "I can do this myself with ChatGPT" | "ChatGPT is a tool. We deploy autonomous agents that run 24/7 without you touching them. Different category." |
| "Too expensive" | "$750 first month, then $5,500. Your time is worth $200+/hr. Saving 10 hrs/week = $8,000/mo in time value. 45% ROI day one." |
| "$5,500/mo after intro?" | "That's for a full agent workforce. We can start with 1-2 agents at $3,500 and scale up as you see results." |
| "Need to think about it" | "Totally get it. What specific concern would help you decide? We can do a 1-agent pilot for 30 days — if it doesn't save you time, we refund." |
| "What about my data?" | "Dedicated server, your data stays isolated. We can sign an NDA before we start. Full audit trail on everything the agents do." |

### 5. Close
- "Want to get started this week? We can have your first agent running by Friday."
- If yes → send Stripe link ($750), schedule onboarding call with Christina
- If maybe → "I'll send a proposal with the exact agents and ROI projections. Can we reconvene Thursday?"

## Competitive Context
- Most AI tools in RE are SaaS platforms ($200-500/mo) — Ylopo, kvCORE, Follow Up Boss
- None offer MANAGED autonomous agents
- Our differentiator: we don't sell software, we deploy a workforce

## After the Call
- If closed: Deploy on Hetzner CX31 immediately, update CRM to "Won"
- If proposal needed: Send within 2 hours using `proposal-template-real-estate.md` (create if needed)
- If dead: Log reason, move to nurture sequence, focus on next prospect
