## Email 1: Initial Outreach (Kacie Conroy, BTV / M3 Insurance)

**Subject:** Congrats on the CIO role — quick thought on AI agents for insurance workflows

Hi Kacie,

Saw the BTV announcement — congrats on the CIO appointment. The timing makes sense. Brokers and carriers are sitting on mountains of manual workflow that AI can actually fix now, not in 2028.

We build managed AI agent workforces for financial services firms. Not chatbots. Actual agents that handle claims processing, policy review, compliance checks — the repetitive stuff that eats 40+ hours a week per team.

One legal services client cut manual review from 40 hours/week to 6. Same quality, fraction of the time.

Given BTV's focus on connecting startups with real broker needs — would it make sense to show you what we're building? 15 minutes, no pitch deck, just a live demo.

Either way, excited to see what you do with BTV's next phase.

Best,
Christina Beckford

## Email 2: Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Congrats on the CIO role

Hi Kacie,

Quick follow-up — I know the first weeks in a new role are chaos.

One data point that might be useful: 76% of insurance executives say they want to buy AI solutions, not build in-house (Deloitte 2025). The problem is most vendors sell platforms. We sell outcomes — working AI agents, managed end-to-end.

Happy to share our insurance automation playbook if it'd be useful. No strings.

## Email 3: Break-up (Day 7)

**Subject:** Last one from me

Hi Kacie,

I'll keep this short — if the timing isn't right, totally get it.

But if BTV is evaluating AI startups for the 2026 Selection Series, we'd love to be considered. We're already live with legal and healthcare clients, and insurance is our next vertical.

Here if you need us.

**Subject:** [Company] + AI agents — cutting manual workflows by 85%

Hi [First Name],

Insurance firms are creating Chief AI/Innovation roles faster than any other industry right now. That tells me something: the manual workflow problem is hitting a breaking point.

We build managed AI agent workforces. Not another SaaS platform to configure. Actual working agents that handle:
- Claims intake and initial assessment
- Policy document review and comparison
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Customer communication triage

One client went from 40 hours/week of manual review to 6. Same accuracy, 85% less time.

Would a 15-minute demo be worth your time this week?
