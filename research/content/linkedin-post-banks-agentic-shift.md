Banks are done with chatbots.

68% of national banks now rank AI as a top-5 spending priority. But here's the shift nobody's talking about:

They're moving from "AI as assistant" to "AI as autonomous operator."

→ Autonomous payment routing
→ Real-time fraud detection without human review
→ Compliance monitoring that generates its own audit trails

Bank of America just bumped tech spend to $14B+. And 42% of US financial firms plan to increase AI investment by 50% or more this year.

The gap isn't between "using AI" and "not using AI" anymore.

It's between firms deploying chatbots and firms deploying agents.

One answers questions. The other does the work.

Which side is your firm on?
