# LinkedIn Post: HHS April 3 AI Deadline

**44 days.**

That's how long healthcare organizations have until the HHS mandate requires AI governance practices across all divisions.

April 3, 2026.

Bias mitigation. Outcome monitoring. Security controls. Human oversight frameworks.

Most health systems we talk to haven't started.

Not because they don't care — because they're stuck figuring out where to even begin. The mandate is broad. The internal AI expertise is thin. And the IT team is already underwater.

Here's what we're telling every healthcare CIO who calls us right now:

→ You don't need to boil the ocean. Pick ONE high-impact workflow (claims processing, clinical documentation, prior auth).
→ Build governance around that single use case.
→ Document it thoroughly.
→ Then expand.

The organizations that will be ready by April 3 aren't the ones with the biggest teams. They're the ones that started with the smallest scope.

If you're a healthcare CIO staring at this deadline, we built a free implementation timeline that maps the 44 days left. DM "HHS" and I'll send it over.
