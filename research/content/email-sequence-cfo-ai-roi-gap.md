## Email 1: The $3M Question

**Subject:** Your AI budget is growing. Is your ROI?

Hi [First Name],

Quick stat that should worry every CFO: 100% of enterprises are expanding AI spend in 2026 (CrewAI survey, last week). But only 18% actually track ROI on their AI investments (Thomson Reuters).

That means 82% of companies are increasing spend on something they can't measure.

At [Company], that probably means $2-5M in AI-adjacent spend this year across tools, pilots, and consultants — with no clear line to revenue impact.

We help companies like yours deploy AI agents that replace specific workflows (compliance screening, contract review, claims processing) with measurable output: hours saved, error rates, cost per transaction.

No pilots. No "transformation roadmaps." Working agents in production within 30 days.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough of how we'd approach [Company]'s use case be worth your time?

Best,

## Email 2: The Friction Problem (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Your AI budget is growing. Is your ROI?

Hi [First Name],

Harvard Business Review published something this week I thought you'd find relevant:

Google Cloud found that agentic AI is *increasing operational friction* for most companies, not reducing it. They called it a "troubling paradox."

The pattern we see: companies buy AI tools, bolt them onto existing processes, then wonder why costs went up and throughput didn't.

The fix isn't more tools. It's fewer tools doing more — autonomous agents that own entire workflows end-to-end.

One of our financial services clients saved $60K/month by replacing a 4-tool compliance stack with a single managed agent.

Happy to share the specifics if useful.

Best,
[Christina / AfrexAI team]

## Email 3: The Number (Day 8)

**Subject:** $3.70

Hi [First Name],

Google Cloud's data: every $1 invested in AI returns $3.70 — but only when it's deployed in production, not stuck in pilot.

Most companies we talk to have 3-5 AI "experiments" running. Zero in production.

We take one high-impact workflow, build an AI agent for it, and get it live in 30 days. Fixed price. If it doesn't hit the ROI target, you don't pay.

That's the offer. 15 minutes to see if it fits?

Best,
[Christina / AfrexAI team]
