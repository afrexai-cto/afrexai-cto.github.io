# LinkedIn Post — "Governance Without Deployment Is Just Paperwork"
*Draft: 2026-02-19 | For AfrexAI company page*

HaystackID just launched AI Governance Services.

Good timing — EU AI Act is live, Colorado SB 205 hits June 30, HHS mandate April 3.

But here's what caught my eye:

They help you build policies, frameworks, audit-ready documentation.

They don't deploy AI agents.

That's like hiring a driving instructor who doesn't own a car.

Governance without working AI is just expensive paperwork. And the companies winning right now aren't the ones with the prettiest policy docs — they're the ones with AI agents actually running in production, WITH governance baked in.

At AfrexAI, we deploy the agents AND build the governance around them. Same engagement. Same team. Because you can't govern what you haven't built.

43 days until the HHS AI mandate deadline.

Your compliance framework won't help if you have nothing to be compliant about.

*Positioning: Deploy + Govern vs. Govern Only. Direct contrast with HaystackID without naming them aggressively.*
