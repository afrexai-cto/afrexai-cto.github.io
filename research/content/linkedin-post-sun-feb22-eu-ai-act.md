Six months.

That's how long until the EU AI Act's high-risk rules go into full enforcement (August 2026).

If your product does any of these for EU customers:
→ Credit scoring
→ Resume screening
→ Insurance pricing
→ Healthcare triage
→ Fraud detection

You're probably in scope. And the requirements aren't light — risk classification, technical documentation, human oversight, post-deployment monitoring, full audit trails.

A developer on DEV Community just shared how they added EU AI Act compliance checks to their CI/CD pipeline. That's the right instinct. But most mid-market companies haven't even started the risk classification step.

The pattern we keep seeing: companies that deployed AI fast in 2024-2025 now discovering their systems were never built for regulatory scrutiny.

August isn't far. Start with one question: "Which of our AI systems touch EU users, and can we document how they make decisions?"
