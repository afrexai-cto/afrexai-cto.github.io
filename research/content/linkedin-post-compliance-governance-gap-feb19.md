# LinkedIn Post: The Compliance Governance Gap

Most financial services firms adopted AI for compliance in 2025.

Very few built the governance to go with it.

The result? Compliance teams that can't:
→ Explain AI outputs during audits
→ Recreate decisions made with AI assistance  
→ Prove when and how AI influenced an outcome

This isn't an AI problem. It's a governance problem.

And regulators noticed. DORA, SEC AI disclosure, Basel III.1 — all converging in 2026. The question shifted from "are you using AI?" to "can you audit it?"

The firms that will thrive aren't the ones with the most AI tools. They're the ones whose AI can explain itself.

That's exactly what we build at AfrexAI — AI agents with compliance-grade audit trails baked in from day one.

If your AI can't explain itself to a regulator, it's a liability, not an asset.
