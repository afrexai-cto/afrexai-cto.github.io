# 3-Part Email Sequence: Multi-Agent Operations
## Target: VP Ops / CTO / COO at mid-market financial services & healthcare

### Email 1: The Shift (Day 0)
**Subject:** Your AI chatbot is about to become irrelevant

Hi [First Name],

Quick question — is your AI doing anything besides answering questions?

PYMNTS reported yesterday that enterprises are moving from chatbots to multi-agent systems — coordinated AI teams where one agent pulls data, another validates it, a third executes, and a fourth handles compliance.

Capital One's already doing it in production. Not pilots. Not labs.

The catch? 95% of organizations can't architect this themselves.

We've been deploying managed multi-agent workforces for mid-market [finserv/healthcare] companies. Compliance-first, governance built in, NIST-aligned.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough of how this looks in [their vertical] be useful?

Best,
Christina Beckford

### Email 2: The Proof (Day 5)
**Subject:** Re: Your AI chatbot is about to become irrelevant

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share a number that stopped me: enterprises using multi-agent orchestration are seeing 30-35% productivity gains (Wells Fargo's own data).

The difference between "AI assistant" and "AI operations" isn't the model. It's the architecture.

Three things most implementations miss:
1. Agent-to-agent handoff protocols
2. Compliance checkpoints between workflow steps
3. Human escalation triggers that actually work

We built a framework that handles all three. Happy to show you.

Best,
Christina

### Email 3: The Close (Day 10)
**Subject:** Re: Your AI chatbot is about to become irrelevant

Hi [First Name],

Last note on this — NIST just launched its AI Agent Standards Initiative. Agent governance is about to go from "nice to have" to "audit requirement."

Companies deploying agents now without governance frameworks will face remediation costs later.

We help [vertical] companies get this right from day one.

If the timing works, I'd love 15 minutes this week.

Best,
Christina
