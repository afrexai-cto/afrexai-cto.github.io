Your competitors' AI agents are working right now.

Saturday morning. 5 AM. No one's in the office.

But at the companies pulling ahead, AI agents are:
→ Processing overnight compliance reports
→ Triaging Monday's inbox before anyone logs in  
→ Running risk assessments across 12 time zones

The FastMode called it this week: "2026 is when work goes asynchronous, and AI agents take over."

Not because humans are being replaced. Because the best companies figured out that AI doesn't need a lunch break.

Here's what we're seeing with our clients:

The ones winning aren't asking "should we adopt AI?"

They're asking "why is our AI workforce only running 8 hours a day?"

The shift from chatbots to autonomous agents isn't incremental. It's architectural.

Capital One embedded multi-agent AI directly into operations — not in a lab, not in a pilot. In production.

Mirantis predicts AI agents will autonomously manage entire infrastructure stacks by year-end.

And enterprises still running "AI experiments" are falling behind by about 16 hours a day.

The question isn't IF your industry adopts autonomous AI agents.

It's whether you'll be the one deploying them — or competing against them.
