# Construction AI Agent Deployment — Proposal Template
*AfrexAI | Managed AI Workforce for Mid-Market Contractors*

---

## For: [Company Name]
## Prepared by: Christina Beckford, CEO — AfrexAI
## Date: [Date]

## The Problem

Construction loses $177 billion annually to coordination failures. Your teams juggle Procore, BIM360, PlanGrid, and a dozen spreadsheets — none of them talk to each other. Meanwhile:

- 650,000+ positions remain unfilled across US construction
- Regulators now expect **predictive** safety insights, not retrospective reports
- Subcontractor coordination eats 30-40% of project manager time
- RFI response times average 7-14 days (should be hours)

You can't hire your way out of a labor shortage. You need systems that multiply the people you already have.

## What We Deploy

AfrexAI deploys a managed AI workforce — autonomous agents that handle the coordination, compliance, and documentation work that buries your project teams.

### Agent 1: Project Coordination Agent
- Monitors all active projects across platforms (Procore, PlanGrid, email)
- Flags schedule conflicts and resource overlaps before they become change orders
- Auto-generates daily progress summaries for stakeholders
- **Impact:** 60-70% reduction in coordination overhead

### Agent 2: Safety & Compliance Agent
- Scans daily reports, weather data, and OSHA updates
- Generates predictive safety alerts (not reactive incident reports)
- Maintains audit-ready documentation automatically
- **Impact:** Proactive safety compliance, reduced OSHA exposure

### Agent 3: RFI & Submittal Agent
- Drafts RFI responses from project documents and specs
- Routes submittals with auto-populated data
- Tracks response times and escalates delays
- **Impact:** RFI response time from 7 days → same day

### Agent 4: Financial Controls Agent
- Monitors change orders against budget thresholds
- Flags cost overruns before they compound
- Generates weekly financial snapshots per project
- **Impact:** 15-25% reduction in cost overruns

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Discovery — map your current tools, workflows, pain points |
| 2-3 | Agent configuration and integration with your stack |
| 4 | Parallel deployment (agents run alongside existing processes) |
| 5-6 | Full deployment with monitoring and tuning |
| 7+ | Ongoing managed operations — we run it, you use it |

**"Week I Win" guarantee:** You see a working demo on YOUR data within 7 days.

## Pricing

| Package | Monthly | What's Included |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Single Agent | $5,500/mo | 1 agent, dedicated infrastructure, 24/7 monitoring, weekly reports |
| Full Workforce (4 agents) | $12,000/mo | All 4 agents, cross-agent coordination, priority support, monthly strategy reviews |

**Introductory offer (first 3 months):** $3,500/mo for single agent, $8,500/mo for full workforce.

Infrastructure cost: ~$8-50/mo (Hetzner dedicated instance). Our margins let us invest in YOUR success.

## ROI Projection

Based on a mid-market contractor ($50M-$500M revenue):

| Metric | Before | After | Annual Savings |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------|
| PM coordination time | 40% of day | 10% of day | $180,000+ (recovered capacity) |
| RFI response time | 7 days | Same day | $320,000 (avoided delays) |
| Cost overrun rate | 15% | 5% | $500,000+ (on $100M projects) |
| Safety incident rate | Industry avg | 40% below | Reduced insurance + OSHA costs |
| **Total estimated annual savings** | | | **$1,000,000+** |

**Payback period: < 8 weeks at $12,000/mo ($144K/yr vs $1M+ savings = 643% ROI)**

## Why AfrexAI

1. **We've done this before.** $111K upfront from our first enterprise client — paid before delivery because they trusted our execution.
2. **Governance built in.** Every agent runs with audit trails, human oversight, and compliance controls. No black boxes.
3. **We run it.** This isn't software you buy and figure out. We deploy, monitor, tune, and operate your AI workforce. You focus on building.
4. **Construction-specific.** We understand Procore, BIM360, PlanGrid, and the way construction actually works. Not generic AI bolted onto your industry.

## Next Steps

1. **15-minute call** — We'll map your biggest coordination pain point
2. **7-day demo** — See agents working on your actual project data
3. **Decision** — Start with one agent or deploy the full workforce
