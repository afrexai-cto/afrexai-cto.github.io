Most AI agencies show you demos.

We got paid $111K before writing a single line of code.

Here's what happened: A legal services company needed document automation. Not a chatbot. Not a "copilot." Actual automation that replaces manual review of thousands of pages.

We scoped it in a week. Delivered a working prototype in two. They paid upfront because the ROI was obvious — their team was burning 40+ hours per week on work our system handles in minutes.

That's the difference between AI-as-a-feature and AI-as-infrastructure.

If your team spends more than 20 hours/week on document review, compliance checks, or data extraction — you're leaving six figures on the table every year.

We build AI systems that pay for themselves in 90 days or less.

DM "automate" and I'll show you exactly where your team is leaking money.
