# LinkedIn Post — Insurtech SB 24-205 Blog Promotion

**For: AfrexAI Company Page**

Colorado's SB 24-205 is live. If your AI touches underwriting, pricing, or claims — you need to prove your models don't discriminate.

Not "we believe they're fair." Prove it. With documentation, bias testing, and ongoing monitoring.

And Colorado is just the start. Connecticut, Illinois, New York are watching. The NAIC model bulletin covers similar ground.

The insurtechs building compliance into their AI stack now will have a 3-5 year structural advantage.

The ones waiting will scramble when the next state passes their version.

We wrote a practical guide on what SB 24-205 actually requires — and how to get compliant in 3 weeks, not 6 months.

3 things most insurtechs miss:
→ Model drift creates new bias over time (quarterly testing isn't enough)
→ You need a manual fallback if a regulator shuts down a model
→ One framework can cover Colorado + NAIC + EU AI Act

If you're running AI in insurance, this is worth 5 minutes.
