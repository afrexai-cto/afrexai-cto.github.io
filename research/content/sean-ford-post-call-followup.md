## If YES (verbal commitment):

**Within 1 hour of call:**
From: Christina Beckford <cbeckford@afrexai.com>
Subject: Welcome aboard, Sean — here's what happens next

Sean,

Great call. Here's what happens this week:

1. **Today**: We provision your dedicated server
2. **Tomorrow**: Your AI agent goes live with your MLS data and CRM
3. **Wednesday**: First automated follow-up sequences running
4. **Friday**: Week 1 report — leads touched, responses generated, time saved

Invoice attached for $750 (first month intro rate). After Month 1, standard rate is $5,500/mo — but you'll have the numbers to justify it ten times over.

Talk soon,
Christina

## If "Let me think about it":

**Wait 24 hours, then:**
From: Christina Beckford <cbeckford@afrexai.com>
Subject: Quick thought on timing, Sean

Sean,

One thing I forgot to mention — we're only onboarding 3 clients this month so we can give each one white-glove setup. After that, onboarding queue opens up in April.

No pressure at all. Just wanted you to have the full picture.

**Immediately after call:**
From: Christina Beckford <cbeckford@afrexai.com>
Subject: Thanks for your time, Sean

Sean,

Appreciate you taking the time today. If anything changes on your end, we're here.

In the meantime, I'll send over a few real estate AI case studies next month — might spark some ideas even if the timing isn't right now.

Best,
Christina
