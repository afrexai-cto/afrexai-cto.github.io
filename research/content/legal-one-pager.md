# AfrexAI for Law Firms — One-Pager

## Your Attorneys Are Drowning in Work That Shouldn't Need a Law Degree

The average associate spends **60% of their time** on tasks AI can handle: document review, contract analysis, due diligence, compliance checks. That's $200K/year in salary doing $40K work.

## What We Do

AfrexAI deploys **managed AI agents** that work alongside your team — not as toys or chatbots, but as actual working systems that handle:

- **Contract Review & Analysis** — First-pass review at 10x speed, flagging risk clauses, deviations from playbook, missing terms
- **Due Diligence Automation** — M&A document rooms processed in hours, not weeks
- **Compliance Monitoring** — Regulatory change tracking across jurisdictions, automated client alerts
- **Legal Research** — Case law analysis, precedent identification, memo drafting
- **Document Generation** — Template-driven drafts with firm-specific clause libraries

## Why Firms Choose Us Over DIY

| | Build In-House | AfrexAI |
|---|---|---|
| Time to value | 6-12 months | 7 days to first demo |
| Upfront cost | $500K+ | $0 |
| AI expertise needed | 3-5 FTEs | Zero — we manage everything |
| Security/compliance | Your problem | Our problem (SOC 2, encryption, audit trails) |
| Ongoing maintenance | Your team | Included |

## The Numbers

- **$3.7 return on every $1 spent** on AI implementation (Google Cloud, 2025)
- **65% reduction** in contract review time (industry benchmark)
- **Troutman Pepper Locke**: 800 people using AI daily, 3,000+ prompts/day
- **95% of AI pilots fail** when firms try to build alone (MIT)

## How It Works

1. **Week 1** — We deploy a working agent on YOUR documents (not a generic demo)
2. **Week 2-4** — Refinement with your team, integration with existing systems
3. **Month 2+** — Full production, ongoing optimization, monthly reporting

**No long-term contracts.** If we don't deliver measurable ROI in 90 days, walk away.
