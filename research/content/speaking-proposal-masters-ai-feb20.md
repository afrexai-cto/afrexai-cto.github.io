# Speaking Proposal: Masters AI Legal Conference

**Talk Title:** "From AI Pilots to AI Workforce: Why 95% of Legal AI Projects Fail and What the 5% Do Differently"

**Speaker:** Christina Beckford, CEO, AfrexAI

## Abstract (150 words)

MIT research shows 95% of AI pilots never reach production. In legal, the failure rate is even higher — firms invest in tools, run demos, publish internal memos, and then... nothing changes.

This talk breaks down the three structural reasons legal AI projects die and the implementation pattern that actually works. Drawing from real deployments across Am Law firms and regulated industries, Christina shares:

- Why "AI-assisted" is a dead end and "AI-managed" is the only model that scales
- The 7-day deployment framework that turned a $111K engagement into production AI agents
- How to measure AI ROI in billable-hour economics (hint: it's not about cost cutting)
- What general counsel actually want vs. what legal tech companies keep building

No vendor pitches. No hype. Just the implementation playbook that works.
