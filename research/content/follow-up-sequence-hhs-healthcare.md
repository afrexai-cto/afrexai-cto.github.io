*Created: 2026-02-15*
*April 3, 2026 deadline — urgency decreases after that date*

## Day 3 — The "Calendar Math" Follow-Up

**Subject:** RE: 47 days until the HHS AI governance deadline

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick math: April 3 is {{days_remaining}} days away. Most AI governance frameworks take 8-12 weeks to implement properly.

That means the window to start and finish on time is closing fast.

We've built AI agents specifically for healthcare compliance — they handle the documentation, audit trails, and reporting that HHS is looking for. One client got audit-ready in 3 weeks.

Worth 15 minutes to see if we can help before the deadline?

## Day 7 — The "Penalty Context" Follow-Up

**Subject:** What HHS enforcement actually looks like after April 3

Hi {{first_name}},

In case it's useful — HHS has signaled that enforcement post-April 3 will focus on three areas:
1. AI decision documentation and audit trails
2. Bias testing and validation records
3. Patient notification procedures for AI-assisted decisions

The organizations that get flagged first are typically ones using AI without governance frameworks, not ones with imperfect ones.

We help healthcare orgs stand up compliant AI governance in weeks, not months. Happy to share exactly what that looks like for a team like yours.

## Day 14 — The "After the Deadline" Pivot

**Subject:** Quick update on HHS enforcement timeline

Hi {{first_name}},

I'd reached out about the April 3 HHS deadline. Even if you've already got a plan in place, wanted to flag one thing:

Post-deadline, the focus shifts to ongoing compliance monitoring — not just initial setup. That's actually where most teams struggle, because it's an operational burden, not a one-time project.

Our AI agents handle continuous compliance monitoring automatically. If that becomes relevant down the road, happy to chat.
