# LinkedIn Post: 100% of Enterprises Expanding Agentic AI in 2026

**Hook:** The debate is over.

**Post:**

100% of enterprises surveyed by CrewAI plan to expand agentic AI this year.

Not 80%. Not "most." Every single one.

But here's what the headline misses:

HBR published a piece this week saying agentic AI is *increasing operational friction* for most companies. Google Cloud is calling it a "troubling paradox."

So everyone's expanding AI... and most are getting worse results.

Why?

Because they're buying tools, not outcomes.

They're deploying chatbots and calling it "AI transformation."

They're running pilots with no path to production.

The companies winning aren't the ones with the most AI tools. They're the ones with AI agents that actually do the work — process claims, review contracts, screen compliance docs — without a human babysitting every output.

That's the gap we fill at AfrexAI.

Not another platform. Not another copilot.

Working AI agents, managed end-to-end, that deliver ROI in weeks, not quarters.

The 2026 question isn't "should we adopt AI?"

It's "who's going to make it actually work?"
