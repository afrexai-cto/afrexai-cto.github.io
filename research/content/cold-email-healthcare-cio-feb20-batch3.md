## Email 1: Aaron Wootton — VP IT & CIO, Stormont Vail Health (Topeka, KS)

**Subject:** Congrats on the Stormont Vail CIO role — quick thought on AI readiness

Hi Aaron,

Congratulations on stepping into the CIO role at Stormont Vail. Exciting time to lead technology at a system navigating digital transformation.

I noticed the CHIME 2026 Leadership Pulse just dropped — 90% of healthcare orgs say modernization is essential, but fragmented systems and disconnected data remain the top blockers. That's basically the job description for every new CIO right now.

We help health systems deploy AI agents that actually work in production — not pilots that stall, but managed AI workflows for clinical documentation, claims processing, and compliance. Our clients typically see measurable ROI within 90 days.

With HHS requiring AI governance practices by April 3rd, there's a real window to get ahead of that mandate rather than scramble to catch up.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense? Happy to share what we're seeing work at similar-sized systems.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: Thomas "Mac" Marlow — VP & CDIO, Bayhealth (Dover, DE)

**Subject:** First 90 days as CDIO — where AI fits at Bayhealth

Hi Mac,

Congratulations on the CDIO appointment at Bayhealth. The digital-and-information officer title says a lot about where Bayhealth is heading — bridging clinical operations with technology strategy.

Quick context: CHIME's 2026 survey just confirmed what you're probably already seeing — nearly 90% of healthcare organizations say modernization is essential, but fragmented tech stacks are the #1 barrier.

We specialize in deploying managed AI agents for health systems — clinical documentation, claims automation, and AI governance compliance. Not theory, not chatbots — production-grade AI workflows with measurable outcomes.

With the HHS AI governance mandate hitting April 3rd, the next 42 days are a real opportunity to get Bayhealth ahead of the curve rather than playing catch-up.

Worth a 15-minute conversation? I can walk you through what similar-sized systems are implementing right now.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
