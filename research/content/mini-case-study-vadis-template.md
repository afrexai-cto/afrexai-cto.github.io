## The Problem
A legal technology company needed AI agents deployed across compliance workflows — document review, risk classification, regulatory monitoring. They'd evaluated 3 platforms and 2 consultancies. Six months of pilot purgatory. Nothing in production.

## What We Did
- Week 1: Assessed their existing tech stack and compliance requirements
- Week 2: Deployed first AI agent handling document classification
- Week 3: Added regulatory monitoring agent with governance controls
- Week 4: Full agent workforce operational — 4 agents, human-in-the-loop oversight, audit trails

## The Result
- **$111K paid upfront** — before full delivery. That's how confident they were after Week 1.
- Compliance review time cut from days to hours
- Zero audit findings related to AI governance
- Full production deployment in under 30 days

## What This Means For [PROSPECT]
*[Customize: reference their specific pain point — HHS deadline, legal privilege exposure, pilot-to-production gap, CSP lock-in, etc.]*

Your team is likely facing the same gap: AI tools everywhere, production deployments nowhere. We don't sell another platform. We deploy, govern, and manage AI agents that actually run your workflows.
