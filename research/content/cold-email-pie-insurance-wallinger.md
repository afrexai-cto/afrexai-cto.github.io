# Cold Email — Pie Insurance (Holly Wallinger, VP Legal & Compliance)

## Angle: Colorado SB 24-205 + Insurance AI Compliance

### Email 1 — Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Colorado SB 24-205 — Pie's AI models covered?

**Body:**

Holly,

Pie's growth in small commercial insurance is impressive — and I imagine your AI-driven underwriting models fall squarely under Colorado's SB 24-205 requirements.

Most insurers I've talked to are scrambling on two fronts: bias testing documentation for the Division of Insurance, and building ongoing monitoring that satisfies the AG's office without slowing down product velocity.

We built a 3-week compliance framework specifically for insurtech companies using AI in underwriting and claims. It covers bias auditing, model documentation, and continuous monitoring — at roughly a third of what the Big 4 charge.

Would a 15-minute call make sense to see if it's relevant for Pie?

### Email 2 — Follow-up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Colorado SB 24-205 — Pie's AI models covered?

Holly,

Quick follow-up. Two things that might be useful regardless:

1. We published a free guide on SB 24-205 compliance for fintechs — happy to send it over
2. The April 2026 HHS AI governance mandate is creating a template that state insurance regulators are watching closely

Even if timing isn't right for a formal engagement, the regulatory landscape is moving fast and I'd value your perspective.

Christina

### Email 3 — Break-up (Day 10)

**Subject:** Re: Colorado SB 24-205 — closing the loop

Holly,

I'll assume the timing isn't right. Totally understand — compliance calendars are packed.

If SB 24-205 readiness becomes a priority, we're at afrexai.com. We've helped similar insurtech companies get compliant in 3 weeks flat.

All the best,
Christina
