# LinkedIn Post — HHS AI Governance Deadline (April 3, 2026)

**VERSION A (Urgency)**

47 days.

That's how long healthcare organizations have before the HHS AI governance mandate kicks in on April 3rd.

Every division. Bias mitigation. Outcome monitoring. Security controls. Human oversight.

And most health systems haven't started.

Here's the thing — this isn't optional. And it's not just about checking boxes. HHS wants to see working AI governance practices, not a PowerPoint deck.

What we're seeing from orgs that are actually ready:

→ Automated bias detection running on every AI model in production
→ Real-time outcome monitoring with human escalation paths  
→ Security frameworks specifically designed for AI systems (not just general IT)
→ Documentation that proves compliance, not just promises it

The orgs scrambling in March will pay 3x what the ones starting today will spend.

If you're in healthcare leadership and haven't mapped your AI systems to the HHS requirements yet — that's your Monday morning priority.

**VERSION B (Educational)**

The HHS AI governance mandate (April 3, 2026) requires something most healthcare orgs aren't ready for:

Proof that your AI systems are actually governed. Not planned. Governed.

That means:
• Bias mitigation — documented and measurable
• Outcome monitoring — continuous, not quarterly
• Security — AI-specific, not general IT policy
• Human oversight — real escalation paths, not theoretical ones

We've been helping health systems build these frameworks in weeks, not months.

The difference between "compliant" and "scrambling" is about 6 weeks of focused work.

Starting now = calm April. Starting in March = expensive April.
