Fintech lenders spent $1.8 billion on compliance last year.

They still got fined $390 million.

The problem isn't budget. It's that manual compliance reviews can't keep up with lending volume.

One mid-size lender processes 50,000 applications per month. Their compliance team reviews 2% of them. The other 98%? Hope and prayers.

Colorado's SB 24-205 just made this worse — now lenders need to prove their AI models aren't discriminating. Every model. Every quarter.

The math doesn't work with humans alone.

We built AI agents that monitor every lending decision in real time. Not spot-checks. Not quarterly audits. Every. Single. One.

One fintech went from 2% review coverage to 100% — and their compliance team actually got smaller.
