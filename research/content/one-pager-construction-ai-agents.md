# Construction AI Workforce — One-Pager
*AfrexAI | February 2026*

## The Problem

Construction loses **$177 billion annually** to poor coordination, rework, and fragmented workflows. Labor shortages are structural — 650,000+ unfilled positions in the US alone. Meanwhile, regulators and clients now expect predictive safety insights, not retrospective reporting.

AI adoption in construction is projected to grow from **$405M (2026) to $6.07B by 2034** — but 95% of AI projects never reach production. The gap isn't the technology. It's implementation.

## What's Changing in 2026

- **AI agents are replacing fragmented workflows** — scheduling, submittals, change orders, safety monitoring now handled by coordinated AI systems (WSJ, Feb 2026)
- **Clients and regulators expect predictive insights** — retrospective reporting is no longer sufficient (Construction Magazine UK)
- **Labor shortages make automation existential** — not optional. Companies that automate coordination gain 10-35% improvements in cost, safety, and efficiency

## Why Mid-Market Contractors Are Stuck

1. **Too many tools, no integration** — Procore, PlanGrid, BIM 360 generate data but don't talk to each other
2. **No AI team** — Enterprise GCs have innovation labs. Mid-market has an IT manager wearing 5 hats
3. **Pilot purgatory** — Tried a chatbot, got disappointed, shelved "AI" entirely
4. **Safety compliance complexity** — OSHA, state regs, client-specific requirements, insurance audits

## AfrexAI Managed AI Workforce for Construction

We deploy production-ready AI agents that work 24/7 across your existing systems:

| Agent | What It Does | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Safety Sentinel** | Monitors incident reports, near-misses, weather conditions. Predicts risk before it happens | 25-40% reduction in recordable incidents |
| **Schedule Optimizer** | Coordinates subcontractor schedules, flags conflicts, manages change orders | 15-20% fewer delays |
| **Compliance Agent** | Tracks OSHA requirements, insurance documentation, certifications | Audit-ready in hours, not weeks |
| **Document Agent** | Processes RFIs, submittals, and change orders across all project stakeholders | 60% faster document turnaround |

## How It Works

1. **Week 1**: We audit your workflows, systems, and pain points
2. **Week 2**: Deploy first agent (usually Safety or Compliance)
3. **Week 3**: Validate results with your team
4. **Ongoing**: Managed operations — we run it, you benefit

## Pricing

- **Single Agent**: $1,500/month
- **Full AI Workforce** (4+ agents): $5,000/month
- **First month intro**: $750 (single agent)

**ROI math**: One prevented safety incident saves $40,000-$150,000 in direct + indirect costs. One agent pays for itself with a single prevented incident.
