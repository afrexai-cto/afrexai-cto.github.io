### Email 1 — "SB 24-205 is live — are you covered?"

**Subject:** Colorado AI law went live Feb 1 — quick question

Hi [Name],

SB 24-205 became enforceable two weeks ago. If [Company] uses AI anywhere in lending decisions, credit scoring, or customer risk assessment, you're now required to maintain impact assessments, consumer notifications, and annual AG reporting.

Most fintech compliance teams we talk to are finding gaps they didn't expect — especially around algorithmic discrimination documentation and the consumer notification requirements.

We've built AI-powered compliance agents that can audit your current AI systems and generate the required documentation in about 3 weeks. Not a 6-month consulting engagement.

Would a 20-minute call this week make sense? I can walk you through exactly what SB 24-205 requires and where most fintechs are falling short.

Best,

### Email 2 (Day 4) — "The part most fintechs miss"

**Subject:** Re: Colorado AI law went live Feb 1

Hi [Name],

Following up — wanted to flag something specific.

Section 6-1-1703 requires deployers to complete an impact assessment "prior to deployment and annually thereafter." But the tricky part: "deployment" includes any material update to an existing AI system. So every model retrain, every feature flag change that touches a lending decision — that's potentially a new assessment.

Most compliance teams don't have processes for that cadence. Our clients use automated monitoring agents that flag when a model update triggers a new assessment requirement.

Happy to share what that looks like in practice — no pitch, just the framework.

### Email 3 (Day 9) — "Quick resource"

**Subject:** SB 24-205 compliance checklist (no strings)

Hi [Name],

Last note on this. We put together a plain-English compliance checklist for SB 24-205 — covers the impact assessment requirements, consumer notification templates, and AG reporting timelines.

No form to fill out. Just the checklist. If it raises questions, I'm here.
