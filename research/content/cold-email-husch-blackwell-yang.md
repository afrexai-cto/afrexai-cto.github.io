## Email 1 — "Adobe-scale AI, law firm reality"

**Subject:** From Adobe's AI stack to Husch Blackwell's — what actually transfers?

**Body:**

Michael,

Going from Adobe to a law firm is a bold move. The AI capability gap between enterprise tech and legal is massive — which is exactly why firms like yours hire people like you.

But here's the catch: most legal AI tools are glorified search with a chatbot UI. You know what real AI architecture looks like. Production agents that handle workflows end-to-end, not just answer questions.

We build and manage AI agent workforces for professional services firms. Not chatbots. Actual autonomous agents that process documents, manage compliance workflows, and handle repetitive legal operations — deployed and producing ROI in 90 days.

Given your background, I think you'd immediately see where this fits in Husch Blackwell's innovation roadmap. Worth 20 minutes?

## Email 2 (Day 4) — "The healthcare + AI compliance angle"

**Subject:** Re: HHS April 3 deadline + Husch Blackwell's healthcare practice

**Body:**

Michael,

Quick follow-up with something time-sensitive.

HHS just mandated all divisions adopt AI governance practices by April 3, 2026. Every healthcare org is scrambling — and they'll need their law firms to understand AI governance deeply.

Husch Blackwell's healthcare practice could lead here. We've built AI governance compliance agents that map directly to the HHS framework: bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security controls, human oversight.

Imagine offering clients an AI governance audit powered by actual AI agents, not just a memo. That's a new revenue line for the firm AND a competitive differentiator.

Happy to show you a working demo. 15 minutes?

## Email 3 (Day 9) — "One stat, then I'll stop"

**Subject:** Re: 3,000 AI prompts per day

**Body:**

Michael,

Last note. Troutman Pepper Locke is running 3,000 AI prompts per day across their firm. That's not experimental — that's operational.

The firms that get to production-scale AI first will have a structural cost advantage that compounds every quarter. The ones still running pilots in 2027 won't catch up.

We help firms skip the pilot phase entirely. If that's on your roadmap, I'd love to connect. If not, no worries — genuinely wish you well with the move from Adobe.

— Christina
