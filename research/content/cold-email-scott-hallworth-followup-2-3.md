# Scott Hallworth (AIG CDO) — Follow-up Emails 2 & 3

## Email 2 — Value drop (Send: 5 days after Email 1)

**Subject:** Re: AI agents for AIG's claims workflow

Scott,

One data point that might be relevant as you build out AIG's data strategy:

A mid-market carrier we work with automated their first-notice-of-loss intake with AI agents. Results after 90 days:
- 73% of routine claims processed without human touch
- Average handling time: 11 min → 1.8 min
- $2.4M annualized savings on a single workflow

At AIG's scale, the math gets interesting fast.

Happy to share the technical architecture if useful — no strings attached.

Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 3 — Break-up / different angle (Send: 7 days after Email 2)

**Subject:** Wrong person?

Scott,

I've reached out a couple times about AI agent deployment for carrier operations — might be barking up the wrong tree.

If there's someone on your team who handles AI vendor evaluations, happy to connect with them instead. Or if the timing's off, no worries — we'll be around.

Either way, here's our insurance one-pager in case it's useful down the line: [link]

Best,
Christina
