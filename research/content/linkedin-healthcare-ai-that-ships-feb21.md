**Topic:** Healthcare investors demand "AI that ships"
**Posting time:** Saturday 9-10 AM EST (B2B healthcare audience)

320 healthcare investors just told us exactly what they're funding in 2026.

Black Book Research surveyed VCs, PE firms, and banks at VIVE and JP Morgan Healthcare. The headline:

"Healthcare technology is still investable — but ONLY when it's deployable, integration-ready, and provably resilient."

Translation: The pilot era is over.

The numbers that should keep every healthcare CIO up at night:

→ 80% of investors say vendor AI claims are impossible to verify without formal governance
→ 70% report at least one FAILED AI pilot from weak endpoints or workflow misalignment
→ 65% now gate funding on unit economics clarity (not just "promising results")
→ 58% are funding AI documentation and clinician workflow automation
→ 52% are funding revenue cycle and prior auth automation

Here's what this means for health systems:

Your board is going to start asking the same questions investors are asking. "Where's the ROI? Where's the governance? Why did our pilot fail?"

The orgs that win in 2026 aren't experimenting with AI. They're deploying AI that works on day one, with governance built in, and measurable outcomes from week one.

That's the difference between "AI strategy" and "AI that ships."
