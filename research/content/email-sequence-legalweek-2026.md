## Email 1 — Day 0 (Send Feb 17): The "See You There" Opener

**Subject:** Catching you at Legalweek — quick question on AI agents

**Body:**

{FirstName},

Saw you're at Legalweek next month — {speaking_detail_or_attending}.

Quick question I'd love your take on: we're seeing a split in how Am Law firms approach AI. Some are deploying prompt-based tools (Co-Counsel, Harvey). Others are moving to autonomous agents that handle full workflows — contract review, regulatory monitoring, compliance auditing — without a human in the loop for every step.

The firms in the second camp are reporting 60-80% time reduction on due diligence and document review. But most are building in-house, which means 6-12 month timelines and $500K+ in engineering costs.

We built an alternative. AfrexAI deploys production-ready AI agents in 7 days, not 7 months. No hallucination risk — every output is traceable and auditable (critical for ABA Rule 1.1 compliance).

Would love 15 minutes at Legalweek to show you what a deployed legal AI agent actually looks like. Not a demo — a working system processing real contracts.

Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — Day 4 (Send Feb 21): The Proof Point

**Subject:** Re: Legalweek — what 3,000 AI prompts/day actually looks like

**Body:**

{FirstName},

One data point that might interest you before Legalweek:

Shook Hardy & Bacon reported their attorneys generate 3,000+ AI prompts per day. That's impressive adoption — but it's also 3,000 opportunities for confidentiality breaches, 3,000 unaudited outputs, and 3,000 interactions with no governance framework.

The gap between "using AI" and "governing AI" is where the real risk lives. And it's where the real competitive advantage is too.

We've built AI governance frameworks that map directly to ABA Model Rules 1.1, 1.6, 5.1, and 5.3 — and the agents to enforce them automatically. Not policy documents. Working systems.

If you're exploring this at Legalweek, I'd love to compare notes. Even 10 minutes between sessions.

## Email 3 — Day 10 (Send Feb 27): The Legalweek Week

**Subject:** One week to Legalweek — last chance to grab time

**Body:**

{FirstName},

Last note before the conference madness begins.

Three things I can show you in 15 minutes at Legalweek:

1. **Contract review agent** — processes 200-page agreements, flags risk, maps to your clause library. 8 minutes vs. 6 hours manual.
2. **Regulatory monitoring** — tracks state-by-state AI legislation changes daily. 47 states have active AI bills right now.
3. **AI governance audit** — maps your current AI usage to ABA Model Rules compliance. Most firms have 3-5 gaps they don't know about.

No pitch deck. No slideshows. Just a laptop and a working system.

Or just grab me at the conference — I'll be easy to find.

See you in New York,
Christina
