## Email 1: The Intro (Send Week 1 of appointment)

**Subject:** Congrats on the [TITLE] role at [COMPANY] — quick thought

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Saw you just stepped into the [TITLE] role at [COMPANY] — congrats. Big shoes, tight timeline.

Most new tech leaders we talk to have the same problem: the board wants AI results in 90 days, but internal teams are 6 months from anything production-ready.

We help companies like [SIMILAR_COMPANY] skip that gap. Our managed AI agents handle [SPECIFIC_USE_CASE] end-to-end — live in production within 2 weeks, not 6 months.

Not pitching anything here. Just wanted to introduce myself in case it's useful as you build your roadmap.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: The Case Study (Send Day 5 after Email 1)

**Subject:** Re: How [SIMILAR_COMPANY] cut [METRIC] by [X]% in 30 days

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Quick follow-up — thought this might be relevant as you're mapping priorities.

[SIMILAR_COMPANY_OR_INDUSTRY_EXAMPLE] was in a similar spot: new leadership, board pressure for AI wins, internal team stretched thin. We deployed [SPECIFIC_AGENT_TYPE] agents that:

- Cut [process] time from [X hours] to [Y minutes]
- Saved $[AMOUNT] in the first quarter
- Went live in [X] days, not months

The trick wasn't the tech — it was having agents that actually work in production, not just demos that look good in a boardroom.

Happy to walk you through the specifics if useful. 15 minutes, no slides.

Christina

## Email 3: The Close (Send Day 4 after Email 2)

**Subject:** Re: Worth a quick call?

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Last note from me — I know the first few months are chaos.

We're working with [NUMBER] companies in [INDUSTRY] right now on managed AI agents. The pattern we keep seeing: execs who deploy something real in the first 60 days build internal credibility that compounds for years.

If you want to compare notes on what's actually working vs what's hype, I've got 15 minutes Thursday or Friday this week.

Either way — wishing you a strong start at [COMPANY].
