*Created: 2026-02-16 12:26 GMT | Target: CISOs & CIOs at mid-market enterprises*

## ICP
- CISOs, CIOs, VP Security at companies $500M-$5B revenue
- Industries: Financial services, healthcare, legal (regulated)
- Pain: Employees deploying unsanctioned AI agents (Okta just launched Shadow AI discovery tool — proves the market)

## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your employees deployed 47 AI agents last month. You approved 3.

Hi {{first_name}},

Okta just launched a tool specifically to detect "shadow AI agents" hiding in enterprise environments. That tells you something about how big this problem already is.

Here's what we're seeing with our clients: the average mid-market company has 5-10x more AI agents running than IT knows about. Some built by developers. Some from third-party tools. Most with zero governance.

For regulated industries like yours, that's not just a security risk — it's a compliance event waiting to happen.

We help companies like {{company}} go from "AI chaos" to "AI workforce" — governed, monitored, and actually delivering ROI. Our last client (legal sector, $111K engagement) went from zero AI governance to full agent deployment in 8 weeks.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this is relevant for {{company}}?

Best,

## Email 2: The Data (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Your employees deployed 47 AI agents last month

{{first_name}},

Quick follow-up with some numbers that might be useful:

- **40% of enterprise AI projects will be canceled by 2027** (Gartner) — mostly due to lack of governance
- **80% of technical leaders already report measurable ROI** from properly managed AI agents (Anthropic, Feb 2026)
- **McKinsey deployed 25,000 agents in <2 years** — but EY and PwC are pushing back, saying quality beats quantity

The gap between "AI agents running wild" and "AI agents generating ROI" is implementation and governance. That's literally all we do.

Would Tuesday or Thursday work for a quick call?

## Email 3: The Case Study (Day 7)

**Subject:** How a legal firm went from AI anxiety to $111K in value — in 8 weeks

{{first_name}},

Last touch on this — wanted to share a quick case:

A mid-market legal services firm came to us with the exact problem you're likely facing: AI tools proliferating across departments, no governance framework, regulators asking questions they couldn't answer.

**8 weeks later:**
- Full AI agent inventory and governance framework
- 3 production agents handling compliance, contract review, and client intake  
- $111K in measurable value from automated workflows
- Clean audit trail for regulators

We're offering a free 30-minute AI Governance Audit for qualified companies this month. No pitch — just an honest assessment of where you stand and what the gaps look like.

Interested?

## Targeting Notes
- **Trigger event:** Okta shadow AI discovery launch (Feb 12, 2026) = market validation
- **Key objection:** "We have security tools already" → "This isn't about security tools, it's about AI-specific governance — different risk surface"
- **Volume:** 500 CISOs/CIOs in regulated mid-market → 17 meetings → 2-3 deals at $200K+ = $400-600K ARR
