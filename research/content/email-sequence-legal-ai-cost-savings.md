## Email 1 (Day 0) — Subject: 16 hours → 4 minutes

Hi [First Name],

Quick question — how many hours does your team spend on complaint responses?

Industry average is 16 hours. Firms using AI agents are doing it in under 4 minutes. That's not a typo.

Jake Edwards at Krevlin and Horst recently built complex case timelines in a fraction of the usual time by deploying AI at the initial stage of client matters. His team processes high-volume litigation without the manual overhead that used to eat their weekends.

We deploy managed AI workforces for law firms — not chatbots, not another SaaS login. Actual agents handling research, drafting, and document review at associate speed with partner accuracy.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough of what this looks like for a firm your size be useful?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 (Day 5) — Subject: Your competitors already did this

Hi [First Name],

Following up — one thing I keep hearing from managing partners is "we're evaluating AI."

Here's what that means in 2026: your competitors already deployed it.

The data from Thomson Reuters shows firms using AI for first-draft work are cutting billable prep by 80%. Contract drafting from 3 hours to 30 minutes. Discovery review from weeks to hours.

Every month without implementation is margin you're leaving on the table.

We handle the entire deployment — no IT burden on your team, no 18-month implementation timeline. Most firms see measurable impact in their first 30 days.

Worth a conversation?

## Email 3 (Day 12) — Subject: Last thought on this

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this brief — Singapore's government just named legal as one of the first professions requiring AI transition support in their 2026 budget. 400% tax deductions for firms that adopt.

The regulatory tailwinds are going global. Firms that implement early get the advantage. Firms that wait become the firms that implemented late.

If the timing isn't right now, no worries at all. But if you want to see what a managed AI workforce looks like for [Firm Name], I'd love to show you.
