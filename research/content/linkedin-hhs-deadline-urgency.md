# LinkedIn Post — HHS AI Governance Deadline

**For: AfrexAI company page**

---

7 weeks.

That's how long healthcare organizations have before the HHS AI governance mandate kicks in (April 3, 2026).

Every division. Bias mitigation. Outcome monitoring. Security protocols. Human oversight frameworks.

Most health systems I've spoken to aren't ready. Not even close.

Here's what we're seeing:

→ CIOs scrambling to inventory which tools even qualify as "AI"
→ Compliance teams trying to retrofit governance onto systems deployed 2+ years ago
→ Boards asking for AI strategies they should have funded 18 months ago

The organizations that will thrive aren't starting governance from scratch. They're deploying AI agents that have governance BUILT IN — audit trails, bias testing, human-in-the-loop by default.

Retrofitting governance onto legacy AI is like adding seatbelts to a car after the crash.

If you're a healthcare CIO or CAIO staring at April 3 wondering where to start — DM me. We've built compliance-first AI agents specifically for this moment.
