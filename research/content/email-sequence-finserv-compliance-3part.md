# 3-Email Sequence: Financial Services Compliance Leaders

## Email 1: The Problem (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your compliance team is about to get 3x more work — with the same headcount

Hi [First Name],

Basel III.1, DORA, and SEC AI disclosure requirements are all converging this year. Every compliance leader I've spoken to says the same thing: the work is growing faster than the budget.

Here's what keeps coming up:
- Firms can't explain AI outputs at audits
- They can't recreate AI-assisted decisions on demand  
- Manual KYC/AML screening is eating 40%+ of analyst time

We help mid-market financial services firms deploy AI agents that handle the repetitive compliance work — screening, monitoring, reporting — while keeping humans in the loop for judgment calls.

One firm reduced their KYC review time by 65% in the first 90 days. Happy to share how.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

## Email 2: Social Proof + Urgency (Day 5)

**Subject:** Re: Your compliance team is about to get 3x more work

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up. Two things happened this week that made me think of you:

1. Microsoft's AI chief told the FT that "most white-collar tasks" will be fully automated in 12-18 months. The firms implementing now get structural advantage.

2. JRG Partners is actively placing "finance executives with AI implementation experience" — the market is moving.

We're not selling software. We deploy managed AI agents that integrate with your existing compliance stack — no rip-and-replace, no 18-month implementation.

Typical engagement starts at $200K and pays for itself within one quarter through reduced manual review hours.

Can I send you a 2-page case study?

## Email 3: Break-up + Value (Day 12)

**Subject:** Last note on this

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short — I know compliance leaders are buried right now.

We put together a free compliance AI readiness checklist specifically for mid-market financial services firms navigating Basel III.1 and DORA. It covers:

- Which compliance workflows are AI-ready today
- Common pitfalls that trigger regulatory scrutiny
- The 3 questions auditors are now asking about AI-assisted decisions

No strings. If it's useful, great. If you want to talk implementation, I'm here.
