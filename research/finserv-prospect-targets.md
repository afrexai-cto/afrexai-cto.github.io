## Outreach Angle
**Subject:** "Colorado just changed the game for AI compliance"
**Hook:** SB 24-205 enforcement starts June 30, 2026 — 4.5 months away. Requires disclosure of AI-driven decisions + algorithmic discrimination protections. Most firms aren't ready.
**Offer:** Free 30-min compliance readiness assessment
**Close:** "We helped a legal team cut 40 hours/week of manual review to 6. Want to see how?"

## Cold Email Template: Colorado AI Compliance

**Subject:** [Company] + Colorado AI Act — 4 months to comply

Hi [First Name],

Colorado's AI Act (SB 24-205) kicks in June 30. If [Company] uses AI in lending, underwriting, or customer decisions — and I believe you do — you'll need algorithmic discrimination protections, impact assessments, and consumer disclosure systems in place.

Most firms I've spoken to are still figuring out what "reasonable care" actually means in practice.

We build AI compliance agents that automate the heavy lifting: continuous bias monitoring, auto-generated impact assessments, and real-time disclosure workflows. One financial services client reduced their compliance review time by 85%.

Worth a 20-minute call to see if we can help [Company] get ahead of the deadline?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## WorkFusion Customer Transition Targets (UiPath Acquisition)
*These banks are confirmed WorkFusion users. UiPath acquisition = vendor uncertainty = our opportunity.*

| Company | Type | WorkFusion Use Case | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------------|-------|
| Raymond James | Financial Advisors | Entity data matching, Perpetual Screening | Leading US independent advisor network |

**Outreach angle:** "Your AML automation vendor just got acquired. Here's what that means for your compliance roadmap — and how AI agents can fill the gap faster than a platform migration."
