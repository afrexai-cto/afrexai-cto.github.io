## Positioning: "Your AI Workforce, Managed"
- 95% of AI pilots fail (MIT). We're the implementation partner that makes AI actually work.
- 76% of enterprises want to BUY not build. We fill the only gap that matters.
- Not a platform. Not chatbots. Actual working AI agents, managed end-to-end.
- Quality moat: competitors get "AI slop" complaints. We don't.
