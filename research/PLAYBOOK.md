*Consolidated: 2026-02-19 08:56 GMT | Living document — updated every 30 min by Revenue Engine*

---

## The Number: 32 Clients × $344K ACV = $11M ARR

| Tier | Clients | ACV | Total |
|------|---------|-----|-------|
| Strategic | 5 | $800K | $4.0M |
| Transform | 15 | $360K | $5.4M |
| Accelerate | 12 | $140K | $1.7M |
| **Total** | **32** | **$344K avg** | **$11.1M** |

## Positioning: "Your AI Workforce, Managed"
- 95% of AI pilots fail (MIT). We're the implementation partner that makes AI actually work.
- 76% of enterprises want to BUY not build. We fill the only gap that matters.
- Not a platform. Not chatbots. Actual working AI agents, managed end-to-end.
- Quality moat: competitors get "AI slop" complaints. We don't.

## Priority Verticals (ranked by speed-to-revenue)

### 1. Financial Services (PRIMARY) — 22.3% of all AI consulting spend
- **Why now:** Basel III.1, AML regs, SEC AI disclosure, fintech pressure
- **Lead with:** Compliance automation PoC (KYC/AML screening)
- **ACV:** $200K-$1M+ | **Cycle:** 3-6 months
- **Target:** 100 mid-market firms ($500M-$5B revenue)
- **Path:** 15-25 clients at $500K-$750K = $11M

### 2. Legal — Shortest cycle (2-4 months), highest margins
- **Why now:** Billable hour model under pressure, $300B industry
- **Lead with:** Contract review agent demo
- **Target:** Am Law 200 + mid-market firms
- **Path:** 10-15 large + 50-100 mid-market = $2-3M ARR

### 3. Healthcare — Stickiest (95%+ retention)
- **Why now:** Labor shortage, burnout, CMS changes
- **NEW DEADLINE: HHS mandate — all divisions must adopt AI governance practices by April 3, 2026** (covers bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security, human oversight)
- **Lead with:** Clinical documentation + claims processing + HHS AI governance compliance
- **Cycle:** 6-12 months (start NOW for Q3-Q4 revenue)
- **HIPAA cert budget:** $15-40K
- **Trend:** Healthcare orgs creating "Chief AI Implementation Officer" roles (HFMA Dec 2025) — target these new hires who need to show quick wins

## Sales Engine

### Cold Email (target: 3+ deals/month)
- 2,000 emails/month × 3.5% response × 30% meeting × 15% close = 3.2 deals
- **Infrastructure needed:** 3 domains, warmup 6 weeks, then full volume
- **Tools:** Instantly.ai or Smartlead for deliverability

### LinkedIn (80%+ B2B buyers are there)
- 4-week nurture: view → connect → share content → pitch
- Christina posts 3-4x/week, boost top performers $50/week
- Sales Navigator for ICP targeting

### Referral Partners (40% close rate!)
- 5 boutique consultancies, 15% revenue share for 12 months
- 1 partner × 1 deal = $120K+ ARR at near-zero CAC

## Pricing Model: Hybrid
- Base retainer + per-agent fees + performance bonus
- Services margins: 70-90% gross
- Cash-flow positive from Month 2

## Key Stats for Every Pitch
- Every $1 in AI → $3.70 return (Google Cloud)

## Financial Services — Market Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-13)

- **WorkFusion (Jan 2026):** "Glass box" AI for compliance — traceable reasoning. Key selling point vs black-box competitors.
- **FintechFutures (Dec 2025):** 2026 = production-scale AI agents in banking. Domain-specific agents for compliance, lending, payments.
