# AfrexAI $11M ARR PLAYBOOK
*Consolidated: 2026-02-20 06:56 GMT | Living document — updated every 30 min by Revenue Engine*

---

## The Number: 32 Clients × $344K ACV = $11M ARR

| Tier | Clients | ACV | Total |
|------|---------|-----|-------|
| Strategic | 5 | $800K | $4.0M |
| Transform | 15 | $360K | $5.4M |
| Accelerate | 12 | $140K | $1.7M |
| **Total** | **32** | **$344K avg** | **$11.1M** |

## Positioning: "Your AI Workforce, Managed"
- 95% of AI pilots fail (MIT). We're the implementation partner that makes AI actually work.
- 76% of enterprises want to BUY not build. We fill the only gap that matters.
- Not a platform. Not chatbots. Actual working AI agents, managed end-to-end.
- Quality moat: competitors get "AI slop" complaints. We don't.

## Priority Verticals (ranked by speed-to-revenue)

### 1. Financial Services (PRIMARY) — 22.3% of all AI consulting spend
- **Why now:** Basel III.1, AML regs, SEC AI disclosure, fintech pressure
- **Lead with:** Compliance automation PoC (KYC/AML screening)
- **ACV:** $200K-$1M+ | **Cycle:** 3-6 months
- **Target:** 100 mid-market firms ($500M-$5B revenue)
- **Path:** 15-25 clients at $500K-$750K = $11M

### 2. Legal — Shortest cycle (2-4 months), highest margins
- **Why now:** Billable hour model under pressure, $300B industry
- **Lead with:** Contract review agent demo
- **Target:** Am Law 200 + mid-market firms
- **Path:** 10-15 large + 50-100 mid-market = $2-3M ARR

### 3. Healthcare — Stickiest (95%+ retention)
- **Why now:** Labor shortage, burnout, CMS changes
- **NEW DEADLINE: HHS mandate — all divisions must adopt AI governance practices by April 3, 2026** (covers bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security, human oversight)
- **Lead with:** Clinical documentation + claims processing + HHS AI governance compliance
- **Cycle:** 6-12 months (start NOW for Q3-Q4 revenue)
- **HIPAA cert budget:** $15-40K
- **Trend:** Healthcare orgs creating "Chief AI Implementation Officer" roles (HFMA Dec 2025) — target these new hires who need to show quick wins

## Fresh Market Intel (Feb 20, 07:00 AM)
- **CIO.com "4 AI Strategy Archetypes" (Feb 20):** Framework confirms our positioning — there's no single "right" AI strategy. Orgs differ by value creation levers + risk tolerance. Most AI consultants sell one-size-fits-all. AfrexAI's vertical-specific approach IS the differentiator. USE THIS: in pitches and content, frame us as "AI strategy aligned to YOUR business model" vs competitors' generic approach.
- **3-part finserv compliance email sequence built** — targets CCOs/CROs at mid-market firms. Leverages Basel III.1 + DORA + SEC convergence. Day 0/5/12 cadence. Ready for Christina to send.
- **Weekend LinkedIn post drafted** — builds on CIO.com framework + positions AfrexAI as strategic implementation partner. Saturday AM posting for weekend B2B engagement.

## Fresh Market Intel (Feb 20, 06:00 AM)
- **CHIME 2026 Leadership Pulse Survey (RLDatix, Feb 20):** 90% of healthcare orgs say modernization is ESSENTIAL. Top blocker: fragmented tech and disconnected data. USE THIS: validation that health systems are ready to buy implementation services — they know they need to modernize but can't do it alone.
- **Becker's CIO moves (Feb 20):** 2 new targets identified — Aaron Wootton (CIO, Stormont Vail Health) and Mac Marlow (CDIO, Bayhealth). Cold emails drafted. Pattern holds: 53% of CIOs in role ≤3 years, only 39% have succession plans = constant pipeline of new CIOs needing quick wins.

## Fresh Market Intel (Feb 20, early morning)
- **Aubrey Bishai (CIO, Vinson & Elkins):** Featured across Passle CMO Series, Harvey, and Axios this week on AI operationalization in law firms. Am Law 50 firm, energy/finance/PE focus. HIGH-VALUE target — publicly championing innovation, receptive to implementation partners.
- **Greg Lambert (CIO, Jackson Walker):** Featured in Texas Lawbook (Feb 17) discussing the "Claude Crash" and agentic AI's impact on lawyers. Am Law 100, Texas-based. Already thinking about agentic disruption = warm target.
- **Masters AI Legal Conference:** New global legal AI conference series launching 2026, Cat Casey anchoring. SPEAKING OPPORTUNITY — draft proposal created. Get AfrexAI on stage as "the implementation firm."

## Fresh Market Intel (Feb 20)
- **Mustafa Suleyman (Microsoft AI chief, Feb 2026):** Told Financial Times "most, if not all" white-collar tasks fully automated in 12-18 months. Lawyers, accountants, PMs, marketers. USE THIS: urgency lever in ALL outreach — "the clock is ticking, firms that implement first get structural advantage."
- **Salesforce Agentforce (Perficient blog, Feb 18):** Positioning Agentforce heavily for financial services — banking, wealth mgmt, asset mgmt. Competitor signal: Salesforce ecosystem firms will push platform-native AI agents. Our counter: we're platform-agnostic, deploy what works best, not what Salesforce sells.

## Fresh Market Intel (Feb 19, late night update)
- **Deloitte Center for Health Solutions (Feb 11):** Surveyed 100 US healthcare tech execs — 40% say talent constraints easing, 38% say change resistance dropping, 35% say leadership buy-in improving. BUT scaling beyond pilots is still THE gap. Agentic AI specifically called out as the next wave. USE THIS: health systems are ready to buy but can't execute internally.
- **Becker's Hospital Review (Feb 2026):** CIOs at Cleveland Clinic, UMMS, and others publicly shifting from "AI experimentation" to "disciplined, scalable AI as core infrastructure." Ryan Vervack (UMMS CTO): "build once, deploy across enterprise." Rohit Chandra (Cleveland Clinic CDO): AI as "catalyst for quality and safety." Mid-market health systems watching these leaders = our targets.
- **Trilliant Health (Feb 2026):** Biden EO 14110 directed HHS to create AI Task Force + quality frameworks. 28 providers/payers signed voluntary "FAVES" principles. Regulatory pressure building = compliance implementation services needed NOW.

## Fresh Market Intel (Feb 19, late evening update)
- **Luware (Feb 5):** "AI without governance fails compliance" — firms in 2025 couldn't explain AI outputs at audits, recreate AI-assisted decisions, or prove AI influence on outcomes. DORA + SEC AI disclosure + Basel III.1 all converging in 2026. USE THIS: compliance governance gap = our exact value prop. 3-email sequence drafted targeting this pain point.
- **JRG Partners (Feb 15):** Executive recruiters actively placing "finance executives with AI implementation experience" — confirms CAIO/Head of AI roles are hot in finserv. These new hires need quick wins = perfect AfrexAI entry point.
- **Robert Half (Feb 2026):** Persistent accounting talent shortage + firms adopting AI but still needing humans to validate results. Mid-market firms can't hire fast enough = outsource to managed AI agents (us).

## Earlier Market Intel (Feb 19, evening update)
- **Business Insider (Feb 17):** McKinsey has "tens of thousands" of internal AI agents, plans 1 per employee (40K). Even Big 4 can't measure AI ROI — former McKinsey partner calls it "the age of confusion." USE THIS: if McKinsey can't figure it out alone, mid-market firms need an implementation partner (us).
- **Neurons Lab** published "Top 8 AI Consulting Firms for FSIs" (Feb 12) — lists Deloitte, Accenture, EY, PwC, IBM, Cognizant, Capgemini, Neurons Lab. AfrexAI not listed = opportunity for differentiation as the nimble alternative.
- **RTS Labs** updated "9 Best AI Consulting Firms" (Feb 15) — includes LeewayHertz, Addepto, Fractal Analytics, Scale AI, Slalom. None positioned as "managed AI workforce" = our positioning is unique.

## Earlier Market Intel (Feb 19)
- **FTI/Relativity GC Report (Feb 18):** 97% GCs increased workload, only 39% using AI = 61% gap. 57% paying more for disputes. 70% mention AI risk concerns. USE IN ALL LEGAL OUTREACH.
- **HaystackID launched AI Governance Services (Feb 17)** — new competitor targeting regulated industries (finserv, healthcare, insurance). Positioning: "defensible AI oversight." We counter with: implementation > governance theater.
- **FCA (UK) studying AI impact on financial services** — HM Treasury appointed advisory panel through Sept 2026. UK finserv firms will need compliance help = opportunity for AfrexAI.
- **Health Catalyst new CEO (Ben Albert, Feb 12)** — healthcare data/AI company in transition. Potential partner or competitor to watch.

See: `content/email-sequences/legalweek-pre-event-outreach.md`

## Financial Services — Market Intelligence (Updated 2026-02-13)
- **Forbes (Nov 2025):** "Precision, not hype" — banks investing in "unsexy" mid-office automation (compliance reporting, legacy modernization). Our positioning fits perfectly.
- **WorkFusion (Jan 2026):** "Glass box" AI for compliance — traceable reasoning. Key selling point vs black-box competitors.
- **FintechFutures (Dec 2025):** 2026 = production-scale AI agents in banking. Domain-specific agents for compliance, lending, payments.
- **PwC:** AI-driven exception management for trade reconciliation, onboarding, P&L attribution — all automatable.
- **Target CCOs identified:** Rob Neal (OakNorth Bank) — mid-market, AI-forward
- **Colorado SB 24-205 UPDATE:** Enforcement delayed to **June 30, 2026** (was Feb 1). 4.5-month window = URGENCY angle for cold outreach. 166 fintechs in Colorado. 10 high-priority targets identified (Homebot, Caribou, Enova, TIFIN, Pie Insurance, etc). Cold email template drafted.
- **UiPath acquired WorkFusion (Feb 10)** — compliance AI customers in vendor transition = warm prospects

## Fresh Market Intel (Feb 20, early morning #2)
- **Federal CAIO Council launched** — Trump admin's April 2025 AI memo + Biden's 2023 EO means every federal agency now has a Chief AI Officer. OMB created a CAIO AI Council for cross-agency coordination. Federal agencies need implementation partners, not just governance. Long cycle (6-12mo) but $500K-$5M+ contracts.
- **Key federal targets**: HHS (Clark Minor, dual-hatted CIO+CAIO, stretched thin), OPM (Perryn Ashmore, workforce automation mandate), NARA (document processing = perfect AI agent use case).
- **Strategy**: Don't chase federal directly (slow procurement). Instead target federal contractors and sub-contractors who need AI implementation capability to win their own bids. Or partner with existing GovCon firm.
