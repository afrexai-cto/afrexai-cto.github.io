|-----------|------------|---------|

## Strategic Takeaway
Neurons Lab is the closest competitor to AfrexAI's positioning in finserv. But they're still a consulting firm — they build and leave. AfrexAI's managed model creates stickier revenue and better outcomes. Use their client list (Visa, AXA, HSBC) as proof the market exists at scale. Their SEO strategy is worth studying — they're winning Google for "AI consulting financial services."

## Action Items
- [ ] Study their SEO keywords and create competing content
- [ ] Position "managed" vs "project" distinction in all outreach
