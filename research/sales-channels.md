# AfrexAI Sales Channels Research

*Compiled: 13 Feb 2026*

---

## 1. Outbound Channels (What's Working in 2025-2026)

### LinkedIn (Top Channel — 80%+ of B2B buyers are on LinkedIn)
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** is the #1 B2B outbound channel for AI services
- Multi-touch sequences: connection request → value-add content → personalised message → call
- Use **Boolean search + ICP filters** (industry, company size, job title, geography)
- **Account-Based Marketing (ABM)**: use Matched Audiences + Sales Navigator to target specific accounts
- AI-driven recommendations now surface buying signals (job changes, funding rounds, content engagement)
- Shift from volume-based to **value-based prospecting** — deep research per account, personalised messaging
- Tools: LinkedIn Sales Navigator Advanced ($150/mo), combined with automation (carefully — stay within LinkedIn limits)

### Cold Email
- Still effective when done right — see Section 3 below for deliverability
- Multi-channel sequences outperform single-channel: **email + LinkedIn + phone**
- Tools: Apollo.io, Instantly.ai, Reply.io, Smartlead

### Phone / Video
- Warm calling (after LinkedIn/email touchpoints) converts significantly better than pure cold calls
- Use intent data to time calls when prospects are actively researching

### WhatsApp / SMS
- Growing as a B2B channel, especially in Africa and emerging markets
- Best as a follow-up channel, not first touch

### AI-Powered Outbound Tools (2025-2026)
| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Apollo.io** | Contact database + AI-powered sequences |
| **Instantly.ai** | Email warmup + high-volume cold email |
| **Reply.io** | Multi-channel sequences (email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, SMS) |
| **Clay** | Data enrichment + personalised outreach at scale |
| **Smartlead** | Email deliverability + inbox rotation |
| **Martal Group** | Fractional SDR team + AI outreach (outsourced) |

## 2. LinkedIn Sales Navigator — Detailed Strategy

### Setup
1. Define ICP precisely: job titles (CTO, VP Engineering, Head of Data, CDO), company size, industry, geography
2. Create **Saved Searches** with Boolean filters for each segment
3. Set up **Account Lists** for top target companies
4. Enable CRM sync (HubSpot/Salesforce integration available on Advanced+)

### Outreach Playbook
1. **Week 1**: View profile, engage with their content (like/comment)
2. **Week 2**: Send personalised connection request (no pitch — reference shared interest or their content)
3. **Week 3**: Share relevant content/case study via DM
4. **Week 4**: Direct value proposition with CTA (meeting/demo)

### Advanced Tactics
- **Buyer Intent signals**: Track who's viewing your company page, engaging with competitors
- **TeamLink**: Leverage warm introductions through your network
- **Smart Links**: Share trackable content to identify engaged prospects
- **InMail**: Use sparingly (higher open rates than email but limited credits)
- **Content-first approach**: Post thought leadership → prospects come to you

### Key Metrics
- Connection acceptance rate target: >30%
- InMail response rate target: >15%
- Aim for 20-30 meaningful conversations per week per SDR

## 3. Cold Email — Deliverability & Best Practices

### Domain & Authentication Setup (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Buy separate domains** for outbound (e.g., afrexai.io, getafrexai.com) — never use your primary domain
2. **SPF Record**: Add to DNS — authorises which servers can send on your behalf
3. **DKIM**: Enable cryptographic signing for all outbound emails
4. **DMARC**: Start with `p=none` (monitor mode), then move to `p=quarantine` → `p=reject`
5. **Custom tracking domain**: Avoid shared tracking pixels that tank reputation

### Domain Warming Schedule
| Week | Daily Volume | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1-2 | 5-10/day | Send to known contacts, get replies |
| 3-4 | 30-50/day | Mix of warm + cold, monitor bounces |
| 5-6 | 80-120/day | Scale gradually, watch spam complaints |
| 7+ | 120-150/day max | Cap per mailbox; add more mailboxes to scale |

### Email Copy Best Practices (2025-2026)
- **Subject line**: Short (3-5 words), no spam triggers, personalised
- **Body**: Under 120 words, plain text (no HTML templates for cold), one clear CTA
- **Personalisation**: Reference specific company challenge, recent news, or tech stack
- **Always include**: Easy opt-out / unsubscribe
- **Spam complaint rate**: Keep under 0.1% (Google/Yahoo enforce this since Feb 2024)
- **Bounce rate**: Keep under 2% — verify all lists before sending

### Tools for Deliverability
- **Instantly.ai**: Built-in warmup + inbox rotation
- **Mailpool**: Warmup network
- **ZeroBounce / NeverBounce**: Email verification
- **Mail-tester.com**: Free deliverability scoring

### Multiple Mailbox Strategy
- Use 3-5 mailboxes per domain
- 3-5 domains = 9-25 mailboxes
- 50 emails/day per mailbox = 450-1,250 emails/day total capacity
- Rotate sending across mailboxes automatically

## 4. Partnership Channels

### Technology Partners (Refer Clients Who Need AI)
- **Cloud providers**: AWS Partner Network, Google Cloud Partner, Microsoft Partner Network — all have AI/ML referral programs

- **Data platforms**: Snowflake Partner Connect, Databricks
- **Integration platforms**: Zapier, Make — list AfrexAI as an integration partner

### Consulting & Services Partners (Co-Sell)
- **Management consultancies**: McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture, PwC — they win strategy engagements and need AI implementation partners
- **Regional IT consultancies**: Especially in target African/UK markets
- **Digital transformation agencies**: They encounter AI needs they can't fulfil
- **System integrators**: Capgemini, Wipro, TCS — subcontract relationships

### Professional Services Referral Partners
- **Accounting firms**: Advise clients on efficiency → refer for AI automation
- **Law firms**: AI for legal tech, contract analysis
- **Recruitment firms**: Encounter companies scaling AI teams → warm intros

### Referral Program Design
- **10-20% revenue share** for first 12 months (standard for B2B services)

## 7. Community-Led Growth

### Strategy (Based on What's Working in 2025-2026)
Community-led growth (CLG) = build a network of champions who drive awareness, conviction, and referrals. Companies like Figma, dbt Labs, and Notion have proven this model.

### Tactics for AfrexAI
1. **Launch an AI community** (Slack/Discord) for your target audience (e.g., "AI Leaders Africa" or "AI for Enterprise" community)
2. **Host monthly virtual roundtables** — invite 10-15 prospects + 2-3 existing clients
3. **Create an "AI Champions" program** — train power users who evangelize
4. **Open-source a tool or framework** — builds credibility and developer goodwill
5. **Run a podcast** interviewing AI leaders in target industries
6. **Contribute to existing communities**: r/MachineLearning, Hacker News, AI Twitter/X, LinkedIn AI groups

### The 5 Ps Framework for B2B CLG
1. **People**: Who is your community for? (Be specific)
2. **Place**: Where do they already gather? (Meet them there)
3. **Purpose**: What unique value does the community provide?
4. **Participation**: How do you drive consistent engagement?
5. **Pipeline**: How does community activity convert to revenue?

### Measurement
- Community size + growth rate
- Active participation rate (target >20%)
- Leads sourced from community
- Revenue influenced by community members
- NPS/referral rate of community members vs. non-members
