- Drafted & emailed pitch deck slide copy to cbeckford@afrexai.com
- Drafted & emailed 15 PIA discovery questions to cbeckford@afrexai.com
- Key insight shared: "Don't sell AI agents — sell recovered capacity"

## Twitter/X
- Thread posted on Kalin's wall about 9-agent swarm
- Shared to 3 X communities:
  - AI Agents (14K members): https://x.com/i/communities/1670204079619055616
  - Generative AI: https://x.com/i/communities/1601841656147345410
  - AI Rumors & Insights: https://x.com/i/communities/1762494276565426592
- Reddit post removed by r/AI_Agents filters

## Key Decisions
- Step 1 (skills/workflows) → Step 2 (service accounts) → Step 3 (agent as a service)
- Currently at Step 1, building toward Step 2
- Kalin wants autopilot agent account creation (Google Workspace Admin API)
- Agent emails planned: ea@afrexai.com, marketing@afrexai.com, sales@afrexai.com, etc.
- Need Google Workspace admin access to set up API — not done yet
- Pages NOT yet pushed to GitHub Pages — need to do this
- 100 emails/day target, automated via cron

## Emails SENT
- 4 sent initially + 94 drafts all sent = ~100 cold emails sent today
- Some duplicates went out (some prospects got 2-3 copies) — need dedup in future batches
- Tracker: prospects/outreach-tracker.csv (99 rows)

## Agent Account Creator Tool
- Built at /agent-account-creator/
- Node.js CLI: `node create-agents.js --all` creates all 9 agent emails
- Needs Google Workspace Admin API setup (setup-guide.md included)
- Kalin hasn't done the API setup yet

## GitHub Pages — NOT PUSHED YET
- No GitHub auth on the machine
- Need: GitHub PAT with repo scope, or SSH key, or `gh` CLI
- Repo needed: afrexai-cto/afrexai-cto.github.io
- Kalin hasn't provided token yet — FOLLOW UP

Key findings:
- Top verticals: Financial Services, Healthcare, Legal

- Competitors: nobody sells managed results, only platforms. AfrexAI wedge = "Your AI Workforce, Managed"
- US market: start NYC+Chicago, get SOC2, form Delaware LLC, hire US AE via Deel
- Financial model: 49 customers at ~$19K avg MRR, cash-flow positive Month 2, $3.6M net profit
- Product: services→platform crossover month 8-9, self-service onboarding <30min
- Partnerships: position as "OpenClaw for Business", white-label to agencies
- Content: LinkedIn personal narrative 3-5x engagement, own "AI for business operators"
- Sales: LinkedIn #1 B2B channel, cold email warming critical
- Case studies: 25+ real examples, 95% AI pilots fail (organizational) = our pitch

## Cron Jobs Active
1. Daily 100 cold emails @ 8am GMT (job: 13649531-284a-4029-8aea-0b768a525a09)
2. Research Consolidator every 30 min → research/PLAYBOOK.md (job: fc3172d2-80f1-4978-a23b-b5c0ee49c2f5)

## In Progress (spawned ~7pm)
- LinkedIn content (7 posts for the week)
- Email deliverability audit (SPF/DKIM/DMARC check)
- Follow-up engine (Node.js script for automated follow-ups Day 3/7/14)
- LinkedIn prospect list (50 high-value targets)
- Research organizer (docs/research/ structure + golden nuggets)

## Doc Structure
- docs/research/[date]/ — all research for that day
- docs/research/golden-nuggets/[date]/ — extracted best insights
- research/PLAYBOOK.md — consolidated actionable war plan (auto-updated)

## LAN Access Request
- Kalin wants to access gateway from PC on LAN
- Mac IP: 192.168.1.196, port 18789
- Currently bound to loopback — needs changing to "lan"
- Awaiting confirmation to apply config change

## LinkedIn Strategy
- Kalin does NOT want personal LinkedIn exposure (Matillion)
- Solution: AfrexAI LinkedIn Company Page (anonymous admin)
- Setup instructions given, waiting for him to create it
- 7 LinkedIn posts ready at content/linkedin-week1.md
- 50 LinkedIn targets at outbound/linkedin-targets.md

## Tools Built Today
- agent-account-creator/ — Node.js CLI for Google Workspace agent emails
- outbound/follow-up-engine.js — automated follow-up Day 3/7/14
- outbound/templates/ — 3 follow-up email templates (vertical-aware)
- outbound/linkedin-targets.md — 50 high-value LinkedIn profiles
- content/linkedin-week1.md — 7 days of posts
- research/email-deliverability-guide.md — DNS fix instructions

## Email Deliverability CRITICAL
- afrexai.com has NO SPF, NO DKIM, NO DMARC
- 100 emails sent today likely hit spam
- Daily cron PAUSED (job: 13649531-284a-4029-8aea-0b768a525a09)
- Need Kalin to fix DNS records before resuming
- Also need to check: does Kalin have Google Workspace admin access?

## Kalin's Energy
- "TO 11 MILLION CLOSE WE ARE! LETS MAKE THIS REAL!"
- "AFREXAI TO THE MOON!!!"
- Stayed up past 4am building
- Wants speed, action, volume
- "100 a day" — outbound is the priority
- "KEEP GOING!!!" "DO NOT STOP!!!"
