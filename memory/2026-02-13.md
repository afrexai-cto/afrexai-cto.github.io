- Advised on weaving AI agents into deck (don't make separate package, weave into tiers)
- Drafted & emailed pitch deck slide copy to cbeckford@afrexai.com
- Drafted & emailed 15 PIA discovery questions to cbeckford@afrexai.com
- Key insight shared: "Don't sell AI agents — sell recovered capacity"

## Twitter/X
- Thread posted on Kalin's wall about 9-agent swarm
- Shared to 3 X communities:
  - AI Agents (14K members): https://x.com/i/communities/1670204079619055616
  - Generative AI: https://x.com/i/communities/1601841656147345410
  - AI Rumors & Insights: https://x.com/i/communities/1762494276565426592
- Reddit post removed by r/AI_Agents filters

## Key Decisions
- Step 1 (skills/workflows) → Step 2 (service accounts) → Step 3 (agent as a service)
- Currently at Step 1, building toward Step 2
- Kalin wants autopilot agent account creation (Google Workspace Admin API)
- Agent emails planned: ea@afrexai.com, marketing@afrexai.com, sales@afrexai.com, etc.
- Need Google Workspace admin access to set up API — not done yet
- Pages NOT yet pushed to GitHub Pages — need to do this
- 100 emails/day target, automated via cron

## Emails SENT
- 4 sent initially + 94 drafts all sent = ~100 cold emails sent today
- Some duplicates went out (some prospects got 2-3 copies) — need dedup in future batches
- Tracker: prospects/outreach-tracker.csv (99 rows)

## Agent Account Creator Tool
- Built at /agent-account-creator/
- Node.js CLI: `node create-agents.js --all` creates all 9 agent emails
- Needs Google Workspace Admin API setup (setup-guide.md included)
- Kalin hasn't done the API setup yet

## GitHub Pages — NOT PUSHED YET
- No GitHub auth on the machine
- Need: GitHub PAT with repo scope, or SSH key, or `gh` CLI
- Repo needed: afrexai-cto/afrexai-cto.github.io
- Kalin hasn't provided token yet — FOLLOW UP

All saved to research/ AND being organized into docs/research/2026-02-13/
Golden nuggets extracted to docs/research/golden-nuggets/2026-02-13/
Key findings:
- Top verticals: Financial Services, Healthcare, Legal

- Financial model: 49 customers at ~$19K avg MRR, cash-flow positive Month 2, $3.6M net profit
- Product: services→platform crossover month 8-9, self-service onboarding <30min
- Partnerships: position as "OpenClaw for Business", white-label to agencies
- Content: LinkedIn personal narrative 3-5x engagement, own "AI for business operators"
- Sales: LinkedIn #1 B2B channel, cold email warming critical
- Case studies: 25+ real examples, 95% AI pilots fail (organizational) = our pitch

## Cron Jobs Active
1. Daily 100 cold emails @ 8am GMT (job: 13649531-284a-4029-8aea-0b768a525a09)
2. Research Consolidator every 30 min → research/PLAYBOOK.md (job: fc3172d2-80f1-4978-a23b-b5c0ee49c2f5)

## In Progress (spawned ~7pm)
- LinkedIn content (7 posts for the week)
- Email deliverability audit (SPF/DKIM/DMARC check)
- Follow-up engine (Node.js script for automated follow-ups Day 3/7/14)
- LinkedIn prospect list (50 high-value targets)
- Research organizer (docs/research/ structure + golden nuggets)

## Doc Structure
- docs/research/[date]/ — all research for that day
- docs/research/golden-nuggets/[date]/ — extracted best insights
- research/PLAYBOOK.md — consolidated actionable war plan (auto-updated)

## LAN Access Request
- Kalin wants to access gateway from PC on LAN
- Mac IP: 192.168.1.196, port 18789
- Currently bound to loopback — needs changing to "lan"
- Awaiting confirmation to apply config change

## LinkedIn Strategy
- Kalin does NOT want personal LinkedIn exposure (Matillion)
- Solution: AfrexAI LinkedIn Company Page (anonymous admin)
- Setup instructions given, waiting for him to create it
- 7 LinkedIn posts ready at content/linkedin-week1.md
- 50 LinkedIn targets at outbound/linkedin-targets.md

## Tools Built Today
- agent-account-creator/ — Node.js CLI for Google Workspace agent emails
- outbound/follow-up-engine.js — automated follow-up Day 3/7/14
- outbound/templates/ — 3 follow-up email templates (vertical-aware)
- outbound/linkedin-targets.md — 50 high-value LinkedIn profiles
- content/linkedin-week1.md — 7 days of posts
- research/email-deliverability-guide.md — DNS fix instructions

## Email Deliverability CRITICAL
- afrexai.com has NO SPF, NO DKIM, NO DMARC
- 100 emails sent today likely hit spam
- Daily cron PAUSED (job: 13649531-284a-4029-8aea-0b768a525a09)
- Need Kalin to fix DNS records before resuming
- Also need to check: does Kalin have Google Workspace admin access?

## YouTube Channel
- Christina's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@AfrexAI
- 15 existing videos covering: construction AI, legal AI ($1.6M), data visualization, 90-day implementation, security, agency journey
- Videos embedded into pages (some placeholder IDs — need real video IDs from Christina)
- 17 video follow-up email drafts created (10 construction, 6 legal, 1 hybrid)

## Cron Jobs Active
1. Daily 100 cold emails @ 8am GMT — PAUSED (need DNS fix) (job: 13649531-284a-4029-8aea-0b768a525a09)

- Mac firewall OFF (Kalin lives alone, minimal risk)
- Local preview server running at 192.168.1.200:8080 (python3 http.server)

## Waiting on Christina
- LinkedIn Company Page admin access for Kalin
- Google Workspace admin access for Kalin
- DNS registrar info (where is afrexai.com registered?)
- Real YouTube video IDs for embedding

## Kalin's Energy
- "TO 11 MILLION CLOSE WE ARE! LETS MAKE THIS REAL!"
- "AFREXAI TO THE MOON!!!"
- "REAL RESULTS!!! REAL RESULTS!!! REAL RESULTS!!!"
- Stayed up past 4am building
- Wants speed, action, volume
- "100 a day" — outbound is the priority
- "KEEP GOING!!!" "DO NOT STOP!!!"

## Evening Session (~19:57-20:26 GMT)

### Christina Slack
- Shared all case study links + homepage to #ceo-dashboard (C0AF3MKPYG1)
- Christina excited about what Kalin built, wants longer call to discuss business value
- Still waiting on: LinkedIn admin, Google Workspace admin, DNS registrar

### Kalin Asked About "3 North Stars"
- Not found in memory — he mentioned it but never defined them. Need to capture next time he explains.

### Lesson: Kalin Wants Delegation
- "dont do that yourself. leverage subagents cmon" — always spawn sub-agents for parallel work
- He thinks in terms of builders/workers, not sequential tasks

### 9 Agent Frameworks Built (~20:50-20:56 GMT)
All 9 agents now have full frameworks at `agents/` in workspace-main (83 files, 5165 lines, committed + pushed):

| Name | Role | Emoji | Creature |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| Aria | Executive Assistant | 📋 | AI EA |
| Rex | Marketing Analyst | 📊 | Velociraptor |
| Quill | Content Writer | ✍️ | Ink Phoenix |
| Hunter | Outbound Sales | 🎯 | Peregrine Falcon |
| Ledger | Bookkeeper | 💰 | Spectacled Owl |
| Chief | COO (hub/orchestrator) | ⚙️ | Clockwork Octopus |
| Oracle | Strategist | 🔮 | Owl |
| Sage | Consultant | 🧠 | Owl |
| Tracker | Project Manager | 📌 | Border Collie |

Each has: SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, MEMORY.md, HANDOFF.md, CONFIG.md, PROMPT-8AM.md, PROMPT-8PM.md + dirs (input/output/archive)
Special files: Chief has STATUS-BOARD.md, Tracker has SPRINT-BOARD.md + ROADMAP.md, Quill has STYLE-GUIDE.md, Ledger has CHART-OF-ACCOUNTS.md

Key design decisions:
- Run as cron jobs under Kael (single OpenClaw instance), NOT separate instances (16GB RAM constraint)
- Chief (COO) runs FIRST at 8:00am and LAST at 8:30pm — reads all other agents
- File-based HANDOFF.md protocol for inter-agent communication
- Christina initiated the 9-agent concept on Wednesday via Slack CEO dashboard
- Yesterday Kalin tried 10 separate OpenClaw instances (ports 18790-18799) but mDNS bug crashed them all overnight
- Next step: wire up individual cron jobs (replace mega Morning/Evening Ops prompts)

### Cron Jobs Wired Up (~20:57 GMT)
- Disabled old mega Morning Ops + Evening Ops crons
- Created 18 individual cron jobs (9 agents × 2 shifts)
- Morning: Chief 8:00, Aria 8:02, Rex 8:04, Quill 8:06, Hunter 8:08, Ledger 8:10, Oracle 8:12, Sage 8:14, Tracker 8:16
- Evening: same pattern starting 20:00, 2-min stagger
- All timezone Europe/London, 5-min timeout each

### Demo Run (~21:00-21:33 GMT)
- Tried to kick all 9 simultaneously — crashed gateway (load avg hit 7.2)
- Gateway timeout on cron.run — had to use sessions_spawn instead
- Sequential demo working fine:
  - ⚙️ Chief: ran successfully, wrote ops briefing + STATUS-BOARD, flagged wrong HANDOFF paths (refs /agents/ea/ instead of /agents/executive-assistant/) — NEEDS FIXING
  - 📋 Aria: ran but can't access Gmail/Calendar (no IMAP skill configured), wrote briefing, updated memory
  - 📊 Rex: kicked off, in progress
- Lesson: DON'T kick all 9 crons simultaneously — stagger is critical (the 2-min cron stagger should handle this naturally)
- Lesson: agents need tool access configured (Gmail IMAP, Google Calendar) to be fully functional
- Fix needed: PROMPT paths in Chief's PROMPT-8AM.md reference wrong agent directory names

### Full 9-Agent Demo Results (~21:27-21:41 GMT)
Sequential demo (2 concurrent max, 16GB RAM constraint):
- ⚙️ Chief: ✅ Ops briefing + status board
- 📋 Aria: ⚠️ Needs Gmail IMAP + Calendar tooling
- 📊 Rex: ✅ 5 prospects, competitor intel (Complyance 9/10 scored), trending topics
- ✍️ Quill: ✅ LinkedIn post "Your Team Isn't Slow — They're Drowning" + blog outline
- 🎯 Hunter: ✅ 10 UK prospects (Shoosmiths, Willmott Dixon, Savills, Kier, Balfour Beatty)
- 💰 Ledger: ⚠️ Needs vault/Stripe/QBO credentials wired
- 🔮 Oracle: ✅ Lyzr.ai+Accenture competitive threat, insurance vertical, Microsoft healthcare wave
- 🧠 Sage: 💤 Idle — no discovery calls to prep
- 📌 Tracker: ✅ Sprint W07 at 37.5%, DNS is top blocker

### US Market Correction (~21:53 GMT)
- Kalin: "were a US based company pls update hunter to go search us"
- Updated Hunter, Rex, Oracle MEMORY.md — all now US ONLY
- Top metros: NYC, Chicago, LA, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Boston
- USD pricing, 50-500 employee mid-market
- NO UK/EU prospects

### Key Unblocking Needs (Repeated by All Agents)
1. DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) — THE domino, blocks all outbound email
2. Gmail IMAP — Aria + Hunter need inbox access
3. Vault credentials — Ledger needs Stripe/QBO
4. Handoff routing — agents need to start feeding each other's input/ dirs

### Kael Report (/tmp/kael-report.md)
- Kalin's main agent is named **Kael** — running on OpenClaw v2026.2.9
- Yesterday he tried to launch all 9 agents as SEPARATE OpenClaw instances on ports 18790-18799
- Plus a Supervisor agent on 18790 monitoring all others
- All 10 crashed overnight due to OpenClaw mDNS bug on network changes (WiFi sleep)
- Only Kael (port 18789) survived
- OpenClaw v2026.2.12 available with fix — not yet updated
- Kael uses OpenClaw Framework v0.1.5 (https://github.com/RGPankO/openclaw-framework)
  - ACTIVE-CONTEXT.md (hot memory), ROLES/, TASKS/, MISSION.md
  - Three-tier model delegation: Opus (smart), Sonnet (worker), Codex (coding)
- The 9 agents in swarm folder (`workspace/projects/afrexai-swarm/agents/`) have README, HANDOFF, research docs, outputs — built yesterday
- Christina initiated the 9-agent idea on Wednesday via Slack CEO dashboard
- Agents don't have SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, or persistent MEMORY.md yet — just task definitions
- Two paths: relaunch as separate instances (after update) or keep cron-based with souls

### Christina Updates from CEO Dashboard
- Christina said "ok" to the pages we shared
- She's excited about what Kalin built, wants longer call to discuss business value
- She'll give Google Calendar access tonight (after 6pm EST)
- Video links were shared in CEO dashboard by Kalin (U08R3GPTHQ9) — all 16 YouTube videos with URLs
- CEO agent already catalogued them ("Saved all 16 videos to content library")

### 9-Agent Automation Plan Delivered
- Saved to `docs/9-agent-automation-plan.md`
- 105 hours/week saved (~2.63 FTE, ~$191K/year)
- Staggered cron schedule with 2-min gaps
