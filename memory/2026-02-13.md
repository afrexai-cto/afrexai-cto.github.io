# 2026-02-13 — Session Notes

## Key Events

### 100 Winning Strategies Document
- Created `products/100-winning-strategies.md` — 100 actionable revenue strategies organized into 6 categories: Product-Led Growth, Distribution & Reach, Revenue Multipliers, Automation & Scale, Information Arbitrage, Growth Hacks
- Kalin loved the format, asked for it as a reference

### 9 Agent Swarm Running
- Kalin launched 9 agents as separate Claude Code browser tabs (NOT OpenClaw sessions):
  - ea (18791), pm (18792), bookkeeper (18793), coo (18794), marketing (18795), content-writer (18796), sales (18797), consultant (18798), strategist (18799)
- These are Chrome renderer client IDs, not OpenClaw session keys — can't use `sessions_send`
- Wrote HANDOFF.md mission files into each agent's directory at `/Users/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace/projects/afrexai-swarm/agents/*/HANDOFF.md`
- Provided copy-paste missions for each tab

### Cron Jobs — Full Autonomy Push
- **Fixed Morning Ops & Evening Ops** — were failing with "Unsupported channel: whatsapp". Changed delivery to `channel: "last", bestEffort: true`
- **NEW: Revenue Machine** (ID: `33343b41`) — every 30 min, deploys SEO blog posts to GitHub Pages, creates resource repos, publishes GitHub Gists, builds ClawHub skills. All with Stripe links
- **NEW: Stripe Sales Monitor** (ID: `ab9eaefd`) — every hour, checks Gmail for Stripe payment notifications and FormSubmit leads, auto-replies, logs to CRM and sales-log.md
- Created log files: `products/revenue-machine-log.md`, `products/sales-log.md`
- Total cron jobs now: **15**
- Kalin's directive: "get me out of the loop make us money!" — everything is now fully autonomous
