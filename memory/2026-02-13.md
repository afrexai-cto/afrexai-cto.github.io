## Key Decisions
- LinkedIn NOT used for Kalin personally — he's Senior Software Engineer at Matillion, doesn't want them to know about AfrexAI
- Christina Beckford is CEO, Kalin is CTO
- Christina owns LinkedIn company page + Google Workspace admin
- Calendly link: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min (30min not 15min)
- YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@AfrexAI

## Afternoon Research Blitz (18:54-19:30)
- Kalin: "PLEASE SPAWN 10 RESEARCHERS KEEP RESEARCHING how to get AFREXAI to 11 MILLION ARR"
- 10 research sub-agents spawned covering: verticals, competitors, pricing, channels, case studies, US market, partnerships, content, financial model, product roadmap
- Set up Research Consolidator cron (every 30min)
- Research organized to docs/research/golden-nuggets/

  - 📌 Tracker (PM), ⚙️ Chief (COO)
- Ran demo of all 9 agents sequentially (limited to 2-3 concurrent due to 16GB RAM)
