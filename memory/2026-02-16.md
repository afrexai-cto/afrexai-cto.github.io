# 2026-02-16 — Daily Notes

## Session Context
- Kalin working late (~4am), high energy
- Channel: webchat (main session)

## Key Events

### Sub-agents can use skills (confirmed + memorized)
- Kalin realized sub-agents inherit full toolset (skills, 1Password, git, etc.)
- Updated MEMORY.md with this under Working Style
- Source: MEMORY.md#L79

### Development Playbook → Builder Skills (IN PROGRESS)
- Christina requested a Development Playbook → shipped to `afrex-os` repo (commit 4b2c589)
- 5 docs: dev-workflow, claude-code-prompts, tech-stack, database-patterns, testing-measures
- **Kalin asked to convert these into 3 OpenClaw builder skills**: planner, developer, tester
- Repo access blocked — `1kalin/afrex-os` can't be cloned (deploy key doesn't have access, GitHub PAT returned "Bad credentials")
- Need to either: get repo access fixed, or have Kalin paste/share the 5 markdown files so we can build the skills

### CEO Dashboard Activity (from Slack #C0AF3MKPYG1)

## Session 2 Continued - Platform Build Sprint (17:52-17:58 GMT)

### 3-Step Engine Complete
- Spawned 3 parallel Opus sub-agents to build all 3 steps end-to-end
- **Step 1 (Skills/CMA):** 4 scripts fully functional + afrexai-skill-publisher skill. Commit 0229699
- **Step 2 (Managed Agents):** 5 scripts + autopilot rewrite (real 7-step e2e) + afrexai-agent-deployer skill. Commit dd38428
- **Step 3 (Hosted):** 7 scripts + pricing-engine.sh + afrexai-hosted-ops skill. Pushed to GitHub.
- Total: 16 production scripts + 3 new skills
- Posted full update to CEO dashboard Slack

### Honest Platform Assessment
- Everything lives in 1 monolith repo (afrexai-cto.github.io) — 7,117 files, 108 HTML pages
- Git remote is WRONG — points to crm-dashboard repo, not main site repo. Needs fixing.
- 8 GitHub repos total under afrexai-cto (all public)
- **Revenue: $0, Customers: 0**
- Scripts work but no Stripe checkout, no self-serve, no real hosted infra
- afrexai.com DNS points to Squarespace not GitHub Pages — still broken
- Stripe API key exists in 1Password but not integrated into any checkout
- CRM has 368 companies but it's static HTML, no real pipeline
- acme-corp is only customer record — it's a test/demo

### Key Insight Shared with Kalin
- We've been building infrastructure without a customer
- Recommended: fix DNS, wire Stripe, make ONE thing buyable, then sell manually first before automating
- Fastest path to revenue = Calendly close + manual deploy using scripts, THEN automate

### LinkedIn
- Goldman Sachs post published: urn:li:share:7429218742766575616
- Recurring LinkedIn cron: Mon/Wed/Fri 10am GMT (id: cfd49490-4175-4ca0-8eca-70600417fc1d)
