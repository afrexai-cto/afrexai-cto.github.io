## Demo Portal Built & Deployed (00:53-01:00)
- Built interactive demo portal with PIV swarm (planner + 2 builders + tester in parallel)
- **3 files deployed to GitHub Pages:**
  - `demo/landing.html` — choose CMA vs Managed experience
  - `demo/index.html` — AfrexAI Managed demo (3 companies: Meridian Health, Pacific Legal, BuildRight, live activity feeds, agent detail, ROI/before-after)
  - `demo/cma.html` — Customer Managed Agents demo (skill library with 10 skills, 3 self-configured agents, activity feed, ROI)
- QA passed — one minor bug fixed (duplicate active class in mobile nav)
- **Fixed git remote** — was pointing to `crm-dashboard.git`, now correctly set to `git@github-afrexai:afrexai-cto/afrexai-cto.github.io.git`
- Live URLs:
  - https://afrexai-cto.github.io/demo/landing.html
  - https://afrexai-cto.github.io/demo/index.html
  - https://afrexai-cto.github.io/demo/cma.html
- Also created demo/SPEC.md, demo/TEST-REPORT.md, demo/choose.html (copy of landing)

## Live Demo Backend Build (02:01 - overnight)
- Kalin asked to build real backend for demo agents while he sleeps
- Planner spawned to design architecture (live-demo-planner running)
- Plan: real OpenClaw agents doing actual work on sample data → activity logs → demo frontend
- Challenge: GitHub Pages is static, need to figure out data pipeline
- Will orchestrate full build autonomously overnight

## Real Agent Proof Layer (03:00)
- Kalin wants REAL agents doing REAL work on sample data with provable deliverables
- Not simulation — actual AI-generated artifacts (contract summaries, compliance reports, site reports)
- Goal: demo that proves capability for AAA community onboarding push
- Building overnight while Kalin sleeps
- Posted demo links to CEO dashboard Slack (C0AF3MKPYG1)

## Demo Portal — Full Build Timeline (00:53-03:03)

### Phase 1: Static Demos (00:53-01:00)
- Planner → 2 builders (managed + CMA) → tester → landing page, all parallel
- `demo/index.html` — Managed agents demo (1050 lines, 3 companies, live activity sim)
- `demo/cma.html` — CMA demo (450 lines, 10 skills, 3 self-managed agents)
- `demo/landing.html` — Choose your experience page
- All pushed to GitHub Pages

### Phase 2: Simulated Backend (02:03-02:10)
- Planner chose Option A: Node.js generator → JSON → git push → GitHub Pages
- `demo/agents/lib/generate.js` — picks random tasks from CSVs, updates activity.json
- 16 sample data files across 3 companies (patients, legal docs, construction projects)
- Cron: generate every 30min (6am-11pm), push every 10min
- Cron IDs: generator=00d144a1, pusher=4a9f8818
- Frontend modified to fetch live data with fallback to client-side simulation
- 🟢 Live Data / 🔴 Simulated badge in header

### Phase 3: Real AI Agents (03:03 - building overnight)
- Kalin wants REAL proof — actual AI-generated deliverables, not simulation
- Two builders spawned: real-agent-runner (Anthropic API + task definitions) + frontend artifacts viewer
- Architecture: Task JSONs → Anthropic API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) → markdown deliverables → activity.json with artifact links
- Deliverables stored at `demo/data/deliverables/{company}/`
- Frontend gets: artifact modal viewer, markdown renderer, "✦ AI Generated" badges, deliverables section
- Budget: ~$0.30-0.50/day in tokens
- **Builders still running — need to test, cron, push when they complete**

### Key Kalin Quotes
- "is it simulated or real? can we prove that our agents are doing real work?"
- "this is great for business idea"
- "i wanna see real agents real proof real deliverables for real customer call"
- "we will soon start posting in the AAA community to get some people onboarded"

- CMA: https://afrexai-cto.github.io/demo/cma.html

### Git Remote Fixed
- Was pointing to crm-dashboard.git, now correctly set to afrexai-cto.github.io.git via SSH

## Business Model Clarification (03:04)
- AfrexAI does NOT sell direct to end businesses
- Target: AAA community agency owners/managers who deploy agents for THEIR clients
- AfrexAI = infrastructure layer, agency owners = service layer (white-label)
- Fully autonomous: agentic layer deploys and manages everything, no humans in the loop
- "agents deploy agents" — that's the $11M architecture
- Kalin's words: "prove me right. prove me real, make us useful."

## Complete Demo Product — Shipped (03:03-03:19)

### What Was Built (full PIV swarm, ~15 sub-agents)
1. **Real AI Deliverables** — 12 professional documents across 3 companies
   - Meridian Health: scheduling confirmation, compliance audit, records request, batch reminders, BAA review
   - Pacific Legal: contract review, client email, brief summary, deadline report
   - BuildRight: daily site report, weekly progress summary, safety report
   - All scored 9.5/10 by validation swarm

2. **Artifact Viewer** — Frontend updated: "✦ AI Generated" badges, "View Output →" modal with markdown renderer, deliverables proof banner on dashboard

3. **New Pages:**
   - `demo/how-it-works.html` — 5-step animated scroll walkthrough (Intersection Observer)
   - `demo/agency.html` — Reseller/AAA page with interactive revenue calculator (slider 1-20 clients)
   - Navigation bar added to ALL 5 demo pages (hamburger on mobile)
   - Landing page expanded to 2x2 grid (4 experiences)

4. **Framework CLI** — `demo/framework/cli.js` with 7 commands: status, generate, deliverable (list/add), push, validate, company add

5. **War Room Board Updated:**
   - Added **project filter** dropdown (Demo Portal, Platform, Skills, Outbound, Website, Infrastructure, Trading)
   - 26 new tickets (id 60-85), total now 85 tickets
   - Project tags show in gold on cards

6. **Validation:** E2E validator caught CSV column mismatches in generate.js — fixed. Browser validator passed all 3 pages.

### Cron Jobs Active
- `00d144a1` — Demo Activity Generator (every 30min, 6am-11pm)
- `4a9f8818` — Demo Data Git Push (every 10min, 6am-11pm)
- `902c2bee` — Demo Real Agent Deliverables (3x/day: 8am, 2pm, 8pm)

### Key Business Model Insight
- AfrexAI does NOT sell direct to end businesses
- Target: AAA community agency owners who deploy for THEIR clients
- Agency owners = service layer, AfrexAI = infrastructure layer
- Fully autonomous agentic deployment — no humans in the loop
- "agents deploy agents" = the $11M architecture
- Agency page has revenue calculator: 10 clients = $48,750/mo profit at 65% margin

### API Key Note
- Kalin shared OAuth token (sk-ant-oat01-...) — works for Claude Code, NOT direct Anthropic API calls
- Demo deliverables cron uses agentTurn (routed through OpenClaw) — no raw API key needed
- 1Password service account lacks permission to create items
