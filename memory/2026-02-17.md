## Demo Portal Built & Deployed (00:53-01:00)
- Built interactive demo portal with PIV swarm (planner + 2 builders + tester in parallel)
- **3 files deployed to GitHub Pages:**
  - `demo/landing.html` — choose CMA vs Managed experience
  - `demo/index.html` — AfrexAI Managed demo (3 companies: Meridian Health, Pacific Legal, BuildRight, live activity feeds, agent detail, ROI/before-after)
  - `demo/cma.html` — Customer Managed Agents demo (skill library with 10 skills, 3 self-configured agents, activity feed, ROI)
- QA passed — one minor bug fixed (duplicate active class in mobile nav)
- **Fixed git remote** — was pointing to `crm-dashboard.git`, now correctly set to `git@github-afrexai:afrexai-cto/afrexai-cto.github.io.git`
- Live URLs:
  - https://afrexai-cto.github.io/demo/landing.html
  - https://afrexai-cto.github.io/demo/index.html
  - https://afrexai-cto.github.io/demo/cma.html
- Also created demo/SPEC.md, demo/TEST-REPORT.md, demo/choose.html (copy of landing)

## Live Demo Backend Build (02:01 - overnight)
- Kalin asked to build real backend for demo agents while he sleeps
- Planner spawned to design architecture (live-demo-planner running)
- Plan: real OpenClaw agents doing actual work on sample data → activity logs → demo frontend
- Challenge: GitHub Pages is static, need to figure out data pipeline
- Will orchestrate full build autonomously overnight

## Real Agent Proof Layer (03:00)
- Kalin wants REAL agents doing REAL work on sample data with provable deliverables
- Not simulation — actual AI-generated artifacts (contract summaries, compliance reports, site reports)
- Goal: demo that proves capability for AAA community onboarding push
- Building overnight while Kalin sleeps
- Posted demo links to CEO dashboard Slack (C0AF3MKPYG1)

## Demo Portal — Full Build Timeline (00:53-03:03)

### Phase 1: Static Demos (00:53-01:00)
- Planner → 2 builders (managed + CMA) → tester → landing page, all parallel
- `demo/index.html` — Managed agents demo (1050 lines, 3 companies, live activity sim)
- `demo/cma.html` — CMA demo (450 lines, 10 skills, 3 self-managed agents)
- `demo/landing.html` — Choose your experience page
- All pushed to GitHub Pages

### Phase 2: Simulated Backend (02:03-02:10)
- Planner chose Option A: Node.js generator → JSON → git push → GitHub Pages
- `demo/agents/lib/generate.js` — picks random tasks from CSVs, updates activity.json
- 16 sample data files across 3 companies (patients, legal docs, construction projects)
- Cron: generate every 30min (6am-11pm), push every 10min
- Cron IDs: generator=00d144a1, pusher=4a9f8818
- Frontend modified to fetch live data with fallback to client-side simulation
- 🟢 Live Data / 🔴 Simulated badge in header

### Phase 3: Real AI Agents (03:03 - building overnight)
- Kalin wants REAL proof — actual AI-generated deliverables, not simulation
- Two builders spawned: real-agent-runner (Anthropic API + task definitions) + frontend artifacts viewer
- Architecture: Task JSONs → Anthropic API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) → markdown deliverables → activity.json with artifact links
- Deliverables stored at `demo/data/deliverables/{company}/`
- Frontend gets: artifact modal viewer, markdown renderer, "✦ AI Generated" badges, deliverables section
- Budget: ~$0.30-0.50/day in tokens
- **Builders still running — need to test, cron, push when they complete**

### Key Kalin Quotes
- "is it simulated or real? can we prove that our agents are doing real work?"
- "this is great for business idea"
- "i wanna see real agents real proof real deliverables for real customer call"
- "we will soon start posting in the AAA community to get some people onboarded"

### Git Remote Fixed
- Was pointing to crm-dashboard.git, now correctly set to afrexai-cto.github.io.git via SSH

## Business Model Clarification (03:04)
- AfrexAI does NOT sell direct to end businesses
- Target: AAA community agency owners/managers who deploy agents for THEIR clients
- AfrexAI = infrastructure layer, agency owners = service layer (white-label)
- Fully autonomous: agentic layer deploys and manages everything, no humans in the loop
- "agents deploy agents" — that's the $11M architecture
- Kalin's words: "prove me right. prove me real, make us useful."
