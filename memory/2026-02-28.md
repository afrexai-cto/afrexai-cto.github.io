## CEO Dashboard Investigation (04:53 GMT)
- Kalin asked why CEO dashboard agent is quiet
- **Key is fine** — CEO agent inherits main Anthropic key (ending `ic58vwAA`), no separate auth-profiles.json
- **Last successful CEO brief: Feb 26** — morning brief posted to Slack OK
- **Feb 27 run skipped** — gateway instability caused missed cron schedules
- `demo-server-keepalive` (ceo agent) erroring with execution timeout
- Gateway unstable: sessions_list timed out, force-trigger of cron job got "gateway closed (1000 normal closure)"
- **Root cause: gateway flakiness, not auth** — needs gateway restart to get ceo dashboard posting again
- Kalin was up at ~5am, typo-heavy (late night energy)
