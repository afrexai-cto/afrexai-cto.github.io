# 2026-02-15 — Massive Build Sprint

## Session Summary (02:29 - 03:04 GMT)

### Infrastructure Changes
- Removed macOS Keychain from git credential helper → switched to `cache` (in-memory, 15 min expiry)
- CRM Dashboard password stored in 1Password: item `rami5rkqsxkpuq552m7wv2kyx4`, vault AfrexAI
- Git push blocked — no SSH key after keychain removal. Kalin needs to push manually.

### 12 Sub-Agents Deployed Tonight
All completed. Some hit API billing limits but delivered files before dying.

### AaaS Platform POC (aaas-platform/)
- `autopilot.sh` — one-command e2e: onboard → deploy agents → health check → welcome email → CRM log
- `agent-deployer.sh`, `customer-onboarding.sh`, `agent-health-monitor.sh`, `health-check.sh`
- Test customer "Acme Corp" with 3 agents deployed
- All bash 3.2 compatible

### Pages Built (36 files, 8,459 lines committed)
- Homepage rebuilt with 3-step vision, full nav, mobile hamburger
- `/aaas/` landing + `/aaas/demo.html` interactive demo
- `/hosted/` premium page + `/hosted/sla.html` + `/hosted/roi-calculator.html`
- `/managed-agents/` + `/managed-agents/security.html` + `/managed-agents/onboarding-guide.html`
- `/skills-landing/` + `/skills-landing/getting-started.html`
- `/skills-showcase/` — 13 skill cards with filtering
- `/portal/` — customer agent status demo
- `/content/blog/why-skills-beat-custom.html`

### Workflows Built (18 scripts)
- `workflows/step1-skills/` — skill-publish-pipeline, skill-analytics, customer-onboard-cma, content-to-skill
- `workflows/step2-agents/` — agent-deploy-remote, agent-update-pipeline, integration-connector, customer-health-dashboard, billing-tracker
- `workflows/step3-hosted/` — provision-customer, multi-tenant-manager, auto-scaler, backup-restore, sla-monitor, customer-portal-data

### Research Reports (4)
- `research/aaas-market-research.md` — no competitor offers fully managed agent workforces
- `research/openclaw-for-business.md` — 70-85% margins, $12-40/mo hosting per customer
- `research/aaas-pricing-economics.md` — path to $11M = ~82 customers at $135K avg, 8 quarters
- `research/aaas-gtm-strategy.md` — first 10 customers in 12 weeks, legal + real estate close fastest

### Email Templates (15)
- `outbound/templates/step1-emails.md` — 5 CMA skill selling emails
- `outbound/templates/step2-emails.md` — 5 managed agent emails
- `outbound/templates/step3-emails.md` — 5 hosted tier CTO-to-CTO emails

### Cron Jobs Added
- `AfrexAI Builder - Morning` (8am GMT daily) — autonomous build sprint
- `AfrexAI Builder - Evening` (8pm GMT daily) — autonomous build sprint

### 3-Step Plan Clarified by Kalin
1. **Skills (CMA)** — Customer buys OpenClaw, manages own agents, buys our skills from ClawHub
2. **Agents** — We deploy and manage agents on THEIR systems
3. **AfrexAI Hosted Agents** — Customer buys OpenClaw securely through us, we host everything

### CEO Dashboard Updates
- Posted 4 updates to #ceo-dashboard (C0AF3MKPYG1): CRM dashboard, closing emails, full vision + numbers, build sprint summary

### Git Push Blocked
- GitHub token in 1Password is for `1kalin` account, NOT `afrexai-cto`
- `afrexai-cto/afrexai-cto.github.io` repo denies `1kalin` — needs collaborator access or a PAT from `afrexai-cto` account
- Keychain removed — git credential helper set to `cache` (in-memory, 15 min)
- Remote URL cleaned to plain HTTPS (no embedded tokens)
- 2 commits sitting local, ready to push once auth sorted
- **SOLVED**: GitHub push uses `op read "op://AfrexAI/GitHub/afrexai_token"` — this is the afrexai-cto account PAT, stored in 1Password vault AfrexAI, item "GitHub" (ID: qfo3tq5gtc2g4y2l3eg53eql3u), field name "afrexai_token". Inject into remote URL, push, then clean URL after. NEVER ask Kalin to push.

### Git Push Issue
- First push (0263bbb) worked fine using inline token in remote URL
- Second push (93c287f - board) HANGS — git push with HTTPS token keeps hanging indefinitely
- credential-cache and credential-store approaches both failed
- Board commit is local, 1 ahead of origin
- The working pattern was: set remote URL with token → push → clean URL. But it's now hanging.
- **FIXED**: Generated SSH deploy key at /tmp/afrexai-deploy, added to repo via API (key ID: 143011347)
- SSH config at ~/.ssh/config uses Host `github-afrexai` with deploy key
- Remote URL set to `git@github-afrexai:afrexai-cto/afrexai-cto.github.io.git`
- HTTPS git push hangs on this machine — always use SSH deploy key
- Deploy key moved to ~/.ssh/afrexai-deploy (permanent)
- SSH config Host `github-afrexai` points to ~/.ssh/afrexai-deploy
- Remote: `git@github-afrexai:afrexai-cto/afrexai-cto.github.io.git`
- **This is the reliable push method. HTTPS hangs. Always use SSH.**

### Revenue Infrastructure Built
- sitemap.xml (58 URLs), robots.txt (blocks dashboards/board/portal)
- Lead capture form at /lead-capture/ (Formspree — needs real endpoint)
- Newsletter page at /newsletter/ (Formspree — needs real endpoint)
- 3 lead magnets: AI audit checklist, ROI template, CIO buyer guide + resource hub
- GA4 injection script at scripts/add-analytics.sh (needs real GA4 ID: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
- Meta tags script at scripts/add-meta-tags.sh (needs OG image at assets/og-image.png)
- Research: pages-to-revenue.md — key finding: custom domain needed, $12/yr fix. Google Ads viable at this price point ($1,500 CAC pays back month 1)

### TODO to activate revenue
- Set up Formspree account, replace xplaceholder endpoints
- Set up GA4 property, replace G-XXXXXXXXXX, run add-analytics.sh
- Run add-meta-tags.sh across all pages
- Create OG image (1200x630)
- Custom domain (afrexai.com → GitHub Pages)

### RULE: On every push, ALWAYS do these 3 things:
1. Update War Room board (board/index.html) — move tasks, add new ones
2. Report to CEO dashboard (Slack C0AF3MKPYG1) — what shipped, links
3. Commit + push everything together
- Update board/index.html task data whenever pushing new work
- Move completed tasks to Done, add new tasks to appropriate columns
- Push board update in same commit

### Total Pages Live
- 28+ pages on GitHub Pages at https://afrexai-cto.github.io/
- All pushed via SSH deploy key (no more HTTPS hanging)

### API Billing
- Multiple sub-agents hit billing limits on the AfrexAI Anthropic key (from 1Password vault).
- Key: `op://AfrexAI/...` — this is the key we use for all API calls.
