## Gateway Issues Diagnosed
- **IMAP login failure**: `op` service account token not resolving during email check cron — empty username/password. Needs token refresh or env sourcing fix.
- **Slack pong timeouts**: Transient `@slack/socket-mode` SDK issue. Not config — Wi-Fi/network blips on macOS. Gateway restart clears it but `commands.restart` is disabled in config.
- **"read tool called without path"**: Minor agent bug, tool call fired with empty params. Harmless.

## Slack Config Verified
- Socket mode, both channels allowlisted (C0AEF3QQDSA, C0AF3MKPYG1)
- CEO dashboard bound to `ceo` agent on C0AF3MKPYG1
- Tokens valid (redacted in config.get)
- Gateway restart blocked by `commands.restart=true` not set — Kalin needs to run `openclaw gateway restart` manually

## Christina's Questions (from Slack)
- Asked what ClawHub skills actually are — answered in Slack by AfrexAI agent
- Asked about dummy form submissions on Agent Setup Wizard — spam/test data coming through, no validation/captcha on form. Needs honeypot + email domain validation + dedup filter. NOT YET BUILT.
- Kalin also flagged repeated emails need filtering

## Memory Search Broken
- `memory_search` tool requires OpenAI/Google/Voyage embedding API key — none configured in auth-profiles.json. This means semantic memory recall is offline.

## Brave Search API Quota Exhausted
- Free tier: 2000/2000 queries used. `web_search` tool returns 429 errors.
- Need to upgrade plan (~$5/mo for 10K) or swap provider.
- Workaround: use `web_fetch` to scrape search results directly.

## Clone Pipeline Metaprompt (Feb 26, 03:52)
- Kalin delivered full metaprompt defining Kael's role as orchestrator of the clone/distribution pipeline
- Division of labor: Kael = orchestration/deploy/monitoring, Claude Code = building/scaffolding, engineer-v4 = quality gate
- Pipeline: Request → Scaffold (AFAF) → Deploy → Verify → Approve → Marketing → Monitor → Notify
- Key repos: admin-skeleton (base template), VADIS, story-lab-v2, afrex-ai-pia
- AFAF already has rebrand manifests for Verdict, StoryLab, Receptionist
- Target: <10 min clone-to-live. $9/mo infra, $1,500/mo charge = 99.4% margin
- CONEXPO construction demo needed by March 3, 2026
- Saved to: docs/research/clone-workflows/CLONE-METAPROMPT.md

## Pending Actions
- [ ] Fix op service account token for email cron
- [ ] Add spam filtering to Agent Setup Wizard form
- [ ] Set `commands.restart=true` in config so gateway can be restarted remotely
- [ ] Configure an embedding provider for memory_search
