### Real E2E Validation Results
- 4 parallel validator swarms ran all 26 systems with real commands
- **24/26 clean PASS, 2 partial (need API keys), 0 code bugs**
- Validation reports at systems/REAL-VALIDATION-WAVE1-4.md

### Repo Access Fixes
- Kalin's macOS user: `kalinsmolichki`
- chmod'd /Users/openclaw, .openclaw, workspace-main for cross-user access
- Created symlink ~/afrexai-workspace → workspace-main
- Made crm-dashboard repo PRIVATE via GitHub API
- Added 1kalin as admin collaborator
- Created new SSH deploy key for crm-dashboard repo (github-crm host alias)
- HTTPS push hangs on this machine — always use SSH via github-crm

### StoryLab Throughput Engine (earlier session, carried over)
- Jacob Johnson's 15-page internal strategy deck for StoryLab 2.0
- Anthropic coding harness + Gemini 3.0 for UI — Feb-Apr 2026 timeline
- Gap analysis: ~40% aligned with our current systems
- Full analysis at research/throughput-engine-analysis.md

### Notes
- Kalin pasted an OAuth token in chat (sk-ant-oat01-...) — told him to store in 1Password instead
- Claude Sonnet 4.6 dropped — model ID: claude-sonnet-4-6
- Kalin wants concise, actionable, revenue-focused communication
