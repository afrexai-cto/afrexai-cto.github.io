## Memory System Created (01:55-02:00)
- Kalin asked about USER.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md — all blank templates
- Discovered NO memory was ever persisted: no MEMORY.md, no memory/ directory, no daily logs
- All context from prior sessions existed only in session context, never written to disk
- Pre-compaction flush triggered — created MEMORY.md + memory/ directory + this file
- USER.md filled in with Kalin's context
- IDENTITY.md filled in as Kael 🏗️
- BOOTSTRAP.md deleted
- Daily memory files created for Feb 13-17 from full session transcript mining (91 sessions)

## Earlier Today (from session context)

### Overnight Swarm Build (04:19-04:27)
- Kalin asked to complete all open work — spawned 6 parallel sub-agents
- All 6 completed in ~8 minutes:
  - #68 Batch 2 deliverables (6 docs) ✅
  - #69 Framework CLI (all 7 commands working) ✅
  - #70 E2E validation (zero errors) ✅
  - #73 Two new demo companies (NovaCRM + Atlas Wealth) ✅
  - #76 Stripe API deploy configs (Render/Railway/Fly) ✅
  - #77 Webhook wired to autopilot.sh ✅
  - #44 OG image + meta tags on 105 pages ✅
  - #7 10 new ClawHub skills built ✅
  - #4 ClawHub publish — rate limited, retry needed
- Board updated, memory logged, all pushed to GitHub

### Afternoon (16:09)
- Kalin checked sub-agent and cron status
- CEO dashboard confirmed working — posting morning + evening reports
- Kalin's message in Slack about fixing .html page names → bot responded with clean URL plan
- 5 agent crons timing out (Ledger, Hunter, Oracle, Sage) — suggested bumping to 600s
- 43 cron jobs total, all healthy except the timeouts

### Key Kalin feedback
- Wants professional URLs (no .html extensions)
- Wants demo.afrexai.com subdomain (CNAME needed from Christina)
- Concerned about whether CEO dashboard was posting (it was)

## Full Memory System Build (01:55-02:05)
- Mined all 91 session transcripts (14MB+) for user messages and key decisions
- Created daily memory files: Feb 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
- Filled USER.md with Kalin's context (CTO, timezone, work style, preferences)
- Filled IDENTITY.md as Kael 🏗️ (builder agent, sharp/autonomous vibe)
- MEMORY.md already comprehensive from project context — enhanced with URLs and preferences
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md
- All committed and pushed (commit b241e99)
- Git had merge conflicts from cron agents pushing concurrently — resolved with merge strategy
- Key discovery: NO memory had ever been persisted to disk before this session despite 6 days of intensive work

## Blockers Summary (end of day)
- Gmail SMTP broken 3+ days — 181 prospects can't be emailed (needs app password in 1Password)
- DNS: Christina needs to update Squarespace CNAME for demo.afrexai.com
- ClawHub publish rate-limited — 10 skills queued for retry
- Hyperliquid + CoinGecko API keys needed from Kalin
- 5 cron agents timing out at 300s — need bump to 600s
- StoryLab $10K Month 1 payment uncollected

## Late Night Updates (03:12-03:23)
- Kalin confirmed webchat control panel works from computer
- Pulled Stripe data via API — 6 real customers, $84.6K gross all-time, $166K implied ARR
- **No StoryLab payment in Stripe** — deal not invoiced
- $10K (PremGrp) and $12,143 (Albert Thombs) stuck on requires_confirmation
- Investigated 4 timing-out cron agents — root causes: heavy prompts + broken QuickBooks + Gmail was down
- **Gmail now LIVE** — Kalin confirmed fixed
- Updated all 4 agents to 900s timeout:
  - Hunter: removed draft mode, Gmail unleashed
  - Ledger AM+PM: removed QuickBooks refs, pointed to PostgreSQL + local CSVs
  - Oracle: told to act on research, not just report
- Filled in IDENTITY.md (Kael 🏗️) and SOUL.md (personalized to AfrexAI build engine)
- Updated MEMORY.md with Stripe customer data and cron fixes

## Infrastructure State
- 43 active cron jobs, 5 with timeout issues
- 367 companies in CRM, 200 contacts
- 291-file AaaS platform with Stripe checkout
