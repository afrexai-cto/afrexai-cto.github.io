## Memory System Created (01:55-02:00)
- Kalin asked about USER.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md — all blank templates
- Discovered NO memory was ever persisted: no MEMORY.md, no memory/ directory, no daily logs
- All context from prior sessions existed only in session context, never written to disk
- Pre-compaction flush triggered — created MEMORY.md + memory/ directory + this file
- USER.md filled in with Kalin's context
- IDENTITY.md filled in as Kael 🏗️
- BOOTSTRAP.md deleted
- Daily memory files created for Feb 13-17 from full session transcript mining (91 sessions)

## Earlier Today (from session context)

### Overnight Swarm Build (04:19-04:27)
- Kalin asked to complete all open work — spawned 6 parallel sub-agents
- All 6 completed in ~8 minutes:
  - #68 Batch 2 deliverables (6 docs) ✅
  - #69 Framework CLI (all 7 commands working) ✅
  - #70 E2E validation (zero errors) ✅
  - #73 Two new demo companies (NovaCRM + Atlas Wealth) ✅
  - #76 Stripe API deploy configs (Render/Railway/Fly) ✅
  - #77 Webhook wired to autopilot.sh ✅
  - #44 OG image + meta tags on 105 pages ✅
  - #7 10 new ClawHub skills built ✅
  - #4 ClawHub publish — rate limited, retry needed
- Board updated, memory logged, all pushed to GitHub

### Afternoon (16:09)
- Kalin checked sub-agent and cron status
- CEO dashboard confirmed working — posting morning + evening reports
- Kalin's message in Slack about fixing .html page names → bot responded with clean URL plan
- 5 agent crons timing out (Ledger, Hunter, Oracle, Sage) — suggested bumping to 600s
- 43 cron jobs total, all healthy except the timeouts

### Key Kalin feedback
- Wants professional URLs (no .html extensions)
- Wants demo.afrexai.com subdomain (CNAME needed from Christina)
- Concerned about whether CEO dashboard was posting (it was)
