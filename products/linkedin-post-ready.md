# LinkedIn Post — Ready to Paste

Last night I deployed 9 AI agents that now run my startup while I sleep.

Not a demo. Not a hackathon project. Real business operations.

Each agent has a job:
→ One triages my inbox
→ One finds prospects matching our ideal customer profile  
→ One drafts content
→ One writes cold outreach
→ One tracks finances
→ One reads all the others' work and produces a daily ops report

They run on morning and evening shifts. The "COO" agent runs last so it can see what everyone else produced.

Here's what surprised me:

The AGENTS aren't the hard part.

The CONTEXT is.

I spent 5x more time writing research files — industry analysis, competitor landscapes, ICP definitions, outreach frameworks — than I spent on any code.

An AI agent without context is an expensive autocomplete.

An AI agent WITH 80KB of industry-specific knowledge? That's a team member.

The marketing agent found 18 prospects I wouldn't have discovered. The content writer produced posts that barely needed editing. The outbound agent drafted personalized emails that actually sounded human.

Total infrastructure cost: $0. Running on a MacBook.

The barrier to AI automation isn't technology anymore. It's knowing what to tell your agents.
