## 📊 Revenue Math

If just 10% of these strategies each bring $100K/year:
**10 × $100K = $1M ARR**

If 20% each bring $50K/year:
**20 × $50K = $1M ARR**

The real play: **stack them**. Every strategy reinforces the others. Free tools feed paid products. Paid products fund services. Services generate case studies. Case studies sell more products.

**Flywheel, not funnel.**
