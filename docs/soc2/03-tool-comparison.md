## Recommendation for AfrexAI

### 🏆 **Pick: Vanta** (with startup pricing)

**Why:**

1. **Name recognition matters for sales.** When enterprise prospects ask "are you SOC 2 compliant?" and you show a Vanta Trust Center, they instantly trust it. Brand matters when you're a 2-person startup trying to close deals.

2. **Broadest integrations.** As an AI company you likely use a mix of cloud providers (AWS/GCP), LLM APIs, GitHub, Slack, various SaaS — Vanta connects to nearly everything.

3. **Startup pricing makes it affordable.** At $3–5k/year for year 1, it's comparable to the others.

4. **Auditor marketplace.** One less thing to figure out.

5. **Growth path.** If you add ISO 27001 or HIPAA later (likely as you sell to enterprise/healthcare), Vanta handles it.

**Runner-up: Drata** — if Vanta's startup pricing isn't available to you, Drata is excellent and often cheaper. Nearly identical functionality.

**When to pick Secureframe:** If budget is the absolute constraint and you just need SOC 2 done cheaply.
