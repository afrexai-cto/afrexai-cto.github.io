# SOC 2 Type II — Timeline & Cost Estimate for AfrexAI

---

## Timeline Overview

SOC 2 Type II requires an **observation period** (minimum 3 months, typically 6–12 months) during which your controls must be operating effectively. The total timeline from "starting today" to "report in hand" is **6–9 months**.

```
Month 1–2:     Preparation & Remediation
Month 3:       Type I readiness (optional — get Type I first for quick sales wins)
Month 3–8:     Observation period (controls operating, evidence collecting)
Month 9:       Audit fieldwork + report issued
```

## Detailed Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–4)

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Sign up for compliance platform (Vanta/Drata). Enable MFA everywhere. Deploy MDM/endpoint security. |
| 1 | Write and adopt all policies (use templates in this package). Both founders sign. |
| 2 | Complete risk assessment. Build vendor inventory. Set up security awareness training. |
| 2 | Enable logging and monitoring on all production systems. Configure alerts. |
| 3 | Implement access control changes (least privilege, remove unused accounts, key rotation). |
| 3 | Set up backup and disaster recovery. Document and test. |
| 4 | Complete gap analysis checklist. Remediate all ❌ items. |
| 4 | Draft system description document for auditor. |

### Phase 2: Stabilize & Optional Type I (Weeks 5–8)

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5–6 | Compliance platform shows green across all controls. Fix any remaining gaps. |
| 6 | Select auditor (via platform marketplace or independently). |
| 7–8 | **Optional: SOC 2 Type I audit** — point-in-time assessment. Useful for sales while you wait for Type II. |

### Phase 3: Observation Period (Months 3–8)

| Activity | Cadence |
|----------|---------|
| Continuous monitoring via compliance platform | Ongoing |
| Quarterly access reviews | Every 3 months |
| Quarterly vulnerability scans | Every 3 months |
| Incident response test/tabletop | Once during period |
| Collect evidence (platform does most automatically) | Ongoing |
| Annual penetration test | Once |

### Phase 4: Type II Audit (Month 8–9)

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Auditor requests evidence. Platform exports most automatically. |
| 2–3 | Auditor fieldwork — interviews, sample testing, evidence review. |
| 4 | Draft report review. Address any findings. |
| 4+ | **Final SOC 2 Type II report issued.** 🎉 |

## Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Get startup pricing on everything.** Compliance platforms, auditors, and pen test firms all discount for startups.
2. **Start with a small scope.** Only include the systems/services that customers care about. Don't audit your internal wiki.
3. **Skip Type I if you can wait.** Go straight to Type II unless you need a report for an active deal.
4. **Use the compliance platform's auditor marketplace.** Bundled deals are common.
5. **Automate everything.** The more your compliance platform collects automatically, the cheaper the audit (less auditor time).
6. **Consider a newer/smaller audit firm.** Big 4 charges 3–5x more. Firms like Prescient Assurance, Johanson Group, or A-LIGN offer quality at startup-friendly prices.
