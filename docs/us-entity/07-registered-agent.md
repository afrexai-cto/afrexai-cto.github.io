## What a Registered Agent Does

- Receives service of process (lawsuits) on your behalf
- Receives state correspondence (annual report notices, tax notices)
- Forwards documents to you promptly
- Must have a physical Delaware address (not a PO Box)
- Must be available during business hours

## ⚠️ Don't Skip This

Delaware **requires** a registered agent. If your agent resigns or you fail to maintain one, the state can dissolve your LLC.
