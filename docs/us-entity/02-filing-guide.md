2. **Hire a registered agent** (see [comparison](./07-registered-agent.md))
3. **File Certificate of Formation** with Delaware Division of Corporations
   - Online: [corp.delaware.gov](https://corp.delaware.gov)
   - Fee: $90 (standard filing)
   - Expedited: +$50 (24-hour), +$100 (same-day), +$1,000 (2-hour)
4. **Get EIN** (see [EIN guide](./05-ein-application.md))
