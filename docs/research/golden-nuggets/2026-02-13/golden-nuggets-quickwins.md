## Day 1-2: Domain & Email Infrastructure

**Action:** Buy 3 outbound email domains (afrexai.io, getafrexai.com, etc.). Configure SPF/DKIM/DMARC on all three. Start warming with Instantly.ai. Cost: ~$50 total.

**Why NOW:** Domains need 5-6 weeks to warm before sending at volume. Every day you delay pushes your first cold-email-sourced deal by a day. This is the single highest-ROI 30-minute task.

**Revenue impact:** Enables 3+ deals/month starting in ~6 weeks.

## Day 1-2: LinkedIn Sales Navigator Setup

**Action:** Subscribe to LinkedIn Sales Navigator ($150/mo). Build saved searches for: CTOs, CIOs, VP Ops at financial services & legal firms, $50M-$500M revenue, US + UK. Start engaging with 10 target prospects' posts daily.

**Why NOW:** LinkedIn nurture takes 3-4 weeks. Starting today means first meetings by early March.

**Revenue impact:** 5-10 meetings within 30 days.

## Day 1-3: Christina Posts LinkedIn Origin Story

**Action:** Christina writes and posts one LinkedIn article: why AfrexAI exists, the vision, the problem being solved. Personal narrative format (3-5x more engagement than brand posts).

**Revenue impact:** 500-2,000 impressions. Establishes brand. Enables warmer outreach.

## Day 1-3: Kalin Posts Demo Video

**Action:** Record a 60-90 second screen recording of an AI agent doing something impressive (processing documents, handling support tickets, etc.). Post to LinkedIn with commentary.

**Why NOW:** Agent demo videos are the #1 engagement format on LinkedIn and Twitter right now. Nothing else demonstrates capability faster.

**Revenue impact:** Credibility proof for all outbound. May generate inbound inquiries directly.

## Day 2-3: Build Target Account List (200 Companies)

**Action:** Using Sales Navigator + Apollo.io, build a list of 200 target companies: 100 financial services + 50 legal + 50 professional services. Export contacts (CTO/CIO/VP Ops).

## Day 3-5: Create the "AI Readiness Assessment" Lead Magnet

**Why NOW:** This is the fastest lead magnet to build. It captures emails, qualifies prospects, and gives a natural reason to book a call.

**Revenue impact:** 5-15 leads/week once promoted on LinkedIn and website.

**Revenue impact:** Each podcast appearance = 5-20 inbound inquiries from qualified listeners.

**Action:** Find 5 boutique IT consultancies, accounting firms, or Fractional CTO services in your network. Send them a simple message: "We deploy AI agents for businesses. Know anyone drowning in manual processes? 15% commission on anything that closes."
