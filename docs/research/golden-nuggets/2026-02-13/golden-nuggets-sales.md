*Extracted: 13 Feb 2026*

## 1. Launch Cold Email Engine at 2,000/Month THIS WEEK

**Insight:** At 3.5% response rate → 70 replies → 21 meetings → 3.2 deals/month. This is the #1 revenue engine.

**Why it matters:** Every day without cold email running is ~0.1 deals lost. The math is simple and proven.

**What to do:** Buy 3 outbound domains TODAY. Configure SPF/DKIM/DMARC. Start warming (5-10/day Week 1-2, scale to 150/day by Week 7). Use Instantly.ai or Smartlead. Target compliance leaders at financial services firms.

**Expected impact:** 3+ deals/month = $500K+ new ARR per month at full capacity.

## 2. LinkedIn Sales Navigator — Book 20 Meetings in 30 Days

**Insight:** 80%+ of B2B buyers are on LinkedIn. Connection acceptance rate target: >30%. 4-week nurture sequence (engage → connect → share value → pitch) converts at 15%+ meeting rate.

**Why it matters:** LinkedIn is the highest-quality B2B channel and the fastest to start producing meetings.

**What to do:** Set up Sales Navigator ($150/mo). Create saved searches for CTOs/CIOs/VP Ops at financial services and legal firms ($50M-$500M revenue). Week 1: engage with content. Week 2: connect. Week 3: share case study. Week 4: pitch meeting.

**Expected impact:** 20-30 meaningful conversations/month per person working LinkedIn.

## 3. The "Paid Discovery" Close — Never Give Away Strategy

**Insight:** $5K-$15K paid discovery workshops credited toward first retainer. This filters serious buyers, generates immediate cash, and builds commitment.

**Why it matters:** Free consultations attract tire-kickers. Paid discovery ensures only real buyers enter your pipeline and creates psychological commitment to buying.

**What to do:** Every inbound lead gets offered a "Paid AI Discovery Workshop" — $5K-$15K for a 2-4 week engagement. Deliverable: AI readiness assessment + implementation roadmap. Credit 100% toward retainer if they proceed.

**Expected impact:** 50%+ discovery-to-retainer conversion. Eliminates wasted time on non-buyers.

## 4. Land 2 Enterprise Deals by June — The $11M Linchpin

**Insight:** The financial model shows that hitting $11M requires 2+ enterprise clients ($25K+/mo) by June. Without them, you max out at $7-8M.

**Why it matters:** Enterprise deals are the difference between a good business and an $11M business.

**What to do:** Identify 20 target enterprise accounts in financial services and healthcare NOW. Multi-thread (reach CTO + VP Ops + CFO simultaneously). Offer a $25K-$50K paid PoC with guaranteed deliverables. Use the Klarna case study ($60M saved) as the opener.

**Expected impact:** 2 enterprise deals at $50K/mo = $1.2M ARR added instantly.

## 5. The "95% of AI Pilots Fail" Pitch

**Insight:** MIT found 95% of AI pilots fail. Gartner says 30% get abandoned after PoC. This is AfrexAI's strongest sales weapon — position as the implementation partner that makes AI actually work.

**Why it matters:** Every prospect has either failed at AI or fears failing. This positions AfrexAI as the solution to the #1 pain.

**What to do:** Lead every sales conversation with: "MIT found 95% of AI pilots fail — not because of the technology, but because of the implementation gap. That's exactly the gap we fill." Follow with Klarna, General Mills, and Ruby Labs case studies.

**Expected impact:** Doubles meeting-to-PoC conversion rate by addressing the core objection before it's raised.

## 6. Attend AI Summit London + Africa Tech Summit (Book 15 Meetings Each)

**Insight:** Conferences have the highest ROI when you book 15-20 meetings BEFORE the event via LinkedIn outreach, then host a side dinner for 10-15 target prospects.

**Why it matters:** One well-executed conference can generate $500K-$1M in pipeline in a single week.

**What to do:** Register for AI Summit London and Africa Tech Summit. 4 weeks before each event, identify attendees on LinkedIn and book meetings. Host a dinner for top 10 prospects. Follow up within 48 hours. Budget: £2K-£5K per event.

**Expected impact:** 5-10 qualified opportunities per event. 2-3 closes within 90 days of each event.

---

## 7. Build 5 Referral Partnerships in 30 Days

**Insight:** Referral deals close at 40% (vs 15% for cold outreach) and have near-zero CAC. Each happy client should produce 1 warm intro per quarter.

**Why it matters:** Referrals are 3x more likely to close and cost almost nothing to acquire.

**What to do:** Identify 5 boutique IT consultancies, accounting firms, or Fractional CTO firms. Offer 15% revenue share for 12 months. Create a partner one-pager and referral form. Host a free "AI for SMBs" workshop for their teams.

**Expected impact:** 0.5-1 deal/month from referrals by Q2, scaling to 2-3/month by Q4.

## 8. Register on G-Cloud / Digital Marketplace TODAY

**Insight:** UK government is actively pushing AI adoption. CCS has dedicated AI frameworks. G-Cloud lets public sector buyers find and procure AI services directly.

**Why it matters:** Government contracts are large ($200K+), sticky (multi-year), and provide credibility that unlocks enterprise sales.

**What to do:** Register on digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk. Attend CCS supplier events. Partner with existing framework suppliers for faster access. Target HMRC, NHS, MOD.

**Expected impact:** 1-2 government contracts worth $200K-$500K each within 12 months. Plus massive credibility boost.

## 9. Form Delaware LLC This Month — US Market Entry

**Insight:** US mid-market is the largest AI buyer pool globally. NYC and Chicago have the highest concentration of target companies. But you CANNOT sell to US mid-market without a US entity, US bank, and W-9.

**Why it matters:** Without a Delaware LLC, you lose deals at procurement. It's a $1K investment that unlocks a multi-billion dollar market.

**What to do:** Form Delaware LLC ($500). Get registered agent ($100-$300/yr). Open Mercury bank account. Get virtual office in NYC. Budget: ~$1K total. Then hire first US AE via EOR (Deel/Remote) at $80K-$120K base.

**Expected impact:** Unlocks the entire US mid-market. Target: $2M-$4M ARR from US within 18 months.

## 10. Create 3 Case Studies with Hard Numbers THIS MONTH

**Insight:** US buyers rank "references from similar companies" as #3 most important factor. "ROI / measurable business impact" is #1. Without case studies with real numbers, you can't compete.

**Why it matters:** Case studies are the single most effective B2B sales asset. Every lost day without them costs you pipeline.

**What to do:** Take your first 3 clients. Document: problem → solution → quantified result. Format: "How we saved [Company] £X/year with AI automation." Even if early clients, anonymize if needed. Publish on website, LinkedIn, and include in every outbound email.

**Expected impact:** 2x improvement in meeting-to-PoC conversion. Required for any enterprise deal.
