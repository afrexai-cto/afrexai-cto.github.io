# Golden Nuggets: The Pricing Model That Wins

## The Winning Model: Hybrid (Base Retainer + Per-Agent + Performance Bonus)

**Insight:** The fastest path to $11M ARR is NOT chasing 500 small customers. It's winning 32-45 mid-to-large enterprises at $250K-$350K average ACV. The hybrid model (base retainer + per-agent fees + performance bonus) maximizes revenue predictability AND upside.

**Why it matters:** Pure project-based = lumpy revenue. Pure usage-based = unpredictable. Pure retainer = capped upside. Hybrid gives you the floor (retainer), the scale (per-agent), and the ceiling (performance bonus). Research shows this model has the highest speed to $11M.

**Exactly what to do:**

### Three Tiers

| Tier | Monthly Fee | Includes | Additional Agents | Target ACV |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Accelerate** | $8K/mo | 2 agents, strategy, integration, support | $2K/mo each | $120K-$180K |
| **Transform** | $20K/mo | 5 agents, dedicated CSM, custom integrations | $3K/mo each | $300K-$480K |
| **Strategic** | $50K-$100K/mo | Full AI transformation, multi-department | Custom | $600K-$1.2M |

### The Fastest Scenario (Scenario A)

| Segment | Customers | Avg ARR | Total |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Strategic | 5 | $800K | $4.0M |
| Transform | 15 | $360K | $5.4M |
| Accelerate | 12 | $140K | $1.68M |
| **TOTAL** | **32** | **$344K** | **$11.08M** |

### 7 Non-Negotiable Pricing Principles

1. **Never charge hourly** — it penalizes your efficiency and AI leverage
2. **Always include recurring revenue** — retainers are the foundation
3. **Price on value, not cost** — saving a client $2M/year? $300K is a bargain
4. **Land and expand** — 1 department → prove ROI → expand to 5
5. **Discovery is PAID** — $5K-$15K, credited toward first retainer
6. **Annual contracts, monthly billing** — predictability for both sides
7. **Performance bonuses on top** — 10-15% of measured impact

### The Wedge Against Big Consultancies

| Factor | Accenture/Deloitte | AfrexAI |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Typical project | $500K-$10M+ | $100K-$500K |
| Time to deploy | 6-18 months | 4-8 weeks |
| Delivery model | Armies of juniors | AI agents + senior experts |

**The killer line:** "Enterprise AI transformation at 1/3 the cost and 3× the speed of Big 4."

**Expected impact:** 32 clients × $344K average = $11M ARR in 18 months. Cash-flow positive from Month 2. ~$3.6M net profit in Year 1.
