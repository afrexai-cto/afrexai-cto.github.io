## 4. Scenarios to $11M ARR

### Scenario A: Enterprise-Heavy (Fastest)
| Segment | Customers | Avg ARR/Customer | Total ARR |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Strategic (Tier 3) | 5 | $800K | $4.0M |
| Transform (Tier 2) | 15 | $360K | $5.4M |
| Accelerate (Tier 1) | 12 | $140K | $1.68M |
| **TOTAL** | **32** | **$344K avg** | **$11.08M** |

**Time to reach:** 18–24 months with strong sales team
**Why fastest:** Fewer deals to close, higher value, stickier relationships

### Scenario B: Balanced Growth
| Segment | Customers | Avg ARR/Customer | Total ARR |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Strategic | 3 | $800K | $2.4M |
| Transform | 20 | $300K | $6.0M |
| Accelerate | 20 | $140K | $2.8M |
| **TOTAL** | **43** | **$260K avg** | **$11.2M** |

**Time to reach:** 24–30 months

### Scenario C: Volume Play (Slowest)
| Segment | Customers | Avg ARR/Customer | Total ARR |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Transform | 10 | $300K | $3.0M |
| Accelerate | 60 | $130K | $7.8M |
| **TOTAL** | **70** | **$154K avg** | **$10.8M** |

**Time to reach:** 30–36 months (more sales cycles, more churn)

### Scenario D: Pure High-Ticket (Aspirational)
- **50 customers × $220K** = $11M
- Realistic if positioning as premium AI consultancy for mid-market+
- Requires strong brand and case studies

### Scenario E: Pure Volume (Hardest)
- **500 customers × $22K** = $11M
- Requires self-serve product, massive marketing spend
- Not recommended for services-led business

---

## 5. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary ICP: Mid-Market to Enterprise (Tier 2 Focus)
- **Revenue:** $50M–$500M annual revenue
- **Industry:** Financial services, healthcare, logistics, professional services, telco
- **Geography:** Africa-headquartered or Africa-operating multinationals, plus UK/US enterprises with Africa operations
- **Pain:** Manual processes, scaling challenges, talent gaps in AI/ML
- **Budget:** $200K–$500K/year for AI transformation
- **Decision-maker:** CTO, CDO, VP Ops, or CEO (at smaller companies)
- **Why they buy:** Can't build AI teams in-house, need speed, want Africa-specific expertise

### Secondary ICP: Large Enterprise / Government (Tier 3)
- **Revenue:** $500M+
- **Budget:** $500K–$2M/year
- **Longer sales cycle (6–12 months) but massive LTV**

### Avoid (for now):
- SMBs under $10M revenue (can't afford, high churn)
- Pure SaaS self-serve buyers (wrong model)

## 6. Competitive Positioning vs. Big Consultancies

| Factor | Accenture/Deloitte | AfrexAI |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Typical AI project | $500K–$10M+ | $100K–$500K |
| Time to deploy | 6–18 months | 4–8 weeks |
| Ongoing relationship | Project-based, re-scope | Retainer, continuous value |
| Africa expertise | Limited, outsourced | Deep, native |
| Staffing model | Armies of juniors | AI agents + senior experts |
| Margin to client | They charge for bodies | You charge for outcomes |

**AfrexAI's wedge:** "Enterprise AI transformation at 1/3 the cost and 3× the speed of Big 4, with Africa-native expertise."

## 7. Revenue Growth Roadmap (Scenario A — Fastest Path)

| Quarter | New Customers | Cumulative | Run-Rate ARR |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Q1 | 3 (Accelerate) | 3 | $420K |
| Q2 | 2 (Transform) + 3 (Accelerate) | 8 | $1.56M |
| Q3 | 1 (Strategic) + 3 (Transform) + 3 (Accelerate) | 15 | $3.66M |
| Q4 | 1 (Strategic) + 3 (Transform) + 2 (Accelerate) | 21 | $5.82M |
| Q5 | 1 (Strategic) + 3 (Transform) + 2 (Accelerate) | 27 | $8.0M |
| Q6 | 2 (Strategic) + 3 (Transform) + 2 (Accelerate) | 34 | $11.2M |

**→ $11M ARR in ~18 months** (aggressive but achievable with 2–3 senior sellers)

## 8. Key Pricing Principles

1. **Never charge hourly** — it penalizes efficiency and AI leverage
2. **Always include recurring revenue** — retainers are the foundation
3. **Price on value, not cost** — if you save a client $2M/year, charging $300K is a bargain
4. **Land and expand** — start with 1 department, prove ROI, expand to 5
5. **Discovery is paid** — never give away strategy; $5K–$15K discovery builds commitment
6. **Annual contracts with monthly billing** — predictability for both sides
7. **Performance bonuses on top** — 10–15% of measured impact, creates alignment and upside

## 9. Summary: The Fastest Path to $11M ARR

| Decision | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Pricing model** | Hybrid: Base retainer + per-agent + performance bonus |
| **Primary target** | Mid-market enterprises ($50M–$500M revenue) |
| **Average deal size** | $250K–$350K ARR |
| **Customers needed** | 32–45 |
| **Timeline** | 18–24 months |
| **Key enabler** | 2–3 enterprise sellers + 3–5 proof-of-concept wins in Q1 |
| **Differentiator** | Africa expertise + speed + AI-agent-led delivery at 1/3 Big 4 cost |

**Bottom line:** Don't chase 500 small customers. Win 30–40 mid-to-large enterprises at $250K+ each. That's the fastest, most capital-efficient path to $11M ARR.
