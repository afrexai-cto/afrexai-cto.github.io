**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Model Period:** January–December 2026
**Starting Point:** Pre-revenue, 2-person team (Kalin CTO + Christina CEO)

---

## 1. Service Tiers & Deal Sizes

| Tier | Description | Monthly Fee | Annual Contract Value | Avg Sales Cycle |
|------|-------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Discovery** | AI audit + PoC (one-off → retainer) | $5K–$15K setup | $10K (one-time) | 2–4 weeks |
| **Build (Accelerate)** | 2–3 agents deployed + retainer | $10K/mo | $120K/yr | 6–10 weeks |
| **Fractional CTO / Transform** | 5+ agents, strategy, dedicated support | $25K/mo | $300K/yr | 8–14 weeks |
| **Enterprise (Strategic)** | Full AI transformation | $60K/mo | $720K/yr | 12–20 weeks |

**Blended ACV assumption:** $180K (weighted toward Build tier early, shifting to Fractional/Enterprise later)

## 2. Customer Acquisition Assumptions

### Channel Conversion Funnel

| Channel | Monthly Volume | Response Rate | Meeting Rate | Close Rate | Deals/Mo |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Cold Email** | 2,000 sent | 3.5% (70 replies) | 30% (21 meetings) | 15% | **3.2** |
| **Inbound (site/content)** | 200 visitors → 15 leads | — | 40% (6 meetings) | 25% | **1.5** |

## 3. Revenue Projections — Month by Month (2026)

### Moderate Scenario (Base Case)

| Month | New Customers | Tier Mix (D/B/F/E) | New MRR | Cumulative Customers | Churned | Active | Total MRR | ARR Run Rate |
|-------|--------------|--------------------|---------|--------------------|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Jan | 2 | 1/1/0/0 | $15K | 2 | 0 | 2 | $15K | $180K |
| Feb | 2 | 1/1/0/0 | $15K | 4 | 0 | 4 | $30K | $360K |
| Mar | 3 | 1/2/0/0 | $25K | 7 | 0 | 7 | $55K | $660K |
| Apr | 4 | 1/2/1/0 | $45K | 11 | 0 | 11 | $100K | $1.2M |
| May | 4 | 1/2/1/0 | $45K | 15 | 1 | 14 | $135K | $1.6M |
| Jun | 5 | 1/2/1/1 | $100K | 20 | 1 | 18 | $225K | $2.7M |
| Jul | 5 | 0/3/1/1 | $115K | 25 | 1 | 22 | $330K | $4.0M |
| Aug | 6 | 0/3/2/1 | $140K | 31 | 1 | 28 | $450K | $5.4M |
| Sep | 6 | 0/3/2/1 | $140K | 37 | 1 | 33 | $570K | $6.8M |
| Oct | 7 | 0/3/2/2 | $200K | 44 | 2 | 38 | $740K | $8.9M |
| Nov | 7 | 0/3/2/2 | $200K | 51 | 2 | 43 | $900K | $10.8M |
| Dec | 7 | 0/2/3/2 | $215K | 58 | 2 | 49 | $920K | **$11.0M** |

**Key assumptions:**
- Discovery clients convert to Build within 1–2 months (modeled as Build MRR after conversion)
- Enterprise deals land Q2+ as pipeline matures
- Monthly churn: 3–5% of customer count (mainly small Discovery clients who don't convert)
- Net Revenue Retention: 110% (upsells from Build → Fractional)

## 4. Customer LTV & Churn

| Tier | Monthly Churn | Avg Lifespan | LTV | CAC | LTV:CAC |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----|-----|---------|
| Discovery (one-off) | 100% (project) | 1 month | $10K | $500 | 20x |
| Build | 4%/mo | 25 months | $250K | $5K | 50x |
| Fractional | 2.5%/mo | 40 months | $1M | $10K | 100x |
| Enterprise | 1.5%/mo | 67 months | $4M+ | $25K | 160x |

**Blended monthly logo churn: 3.5%**
**Blended monthly revenue churn: 2% (smaller clients churn more)**
**Net revenue retention: 110–120%** (upsell/expansion offsets gross churn)

**CAC assumptions:**
- Cold email: ~$2K/deal (tools + time)
- Inbound: ~$5K/deal (content + SEO + time)
- Referral: ~$1K/deal
- Blended CAC: ~$4K (early), dropping to $3K at scale

## 6. Profit & Loss Summary (2026)

| Quarter | Revenue | Costs | Profit/Loss | Cumulative |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Q1** | $100K | $66K | **+$34K** | +$34K |
| **Q2** | $460K | $142.5K | **+$317.5K** | +$351.5K |
| **Q3** | $1,350K | $270K | **+$1,080K** | +$1,431.5K |
| **Q4** | $2,560K | $417K | **+$2,143K** | **+$3,574.5K** |

**Full Year Revenue: ~$4.47M collected** (ARR run rate hits $11M in Dec)
**Full Year Costs: ~$895K**
**Full Year Profit: ~$3.57M**
**Gross Margin: ~80%**

> Note: $11M is the ARR *run rate* by December. Actual cash collected in 2026 is ~$4.5M. The $11M means you're billing ~$920K/month by Dec.

## 7. Break-Even Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Monthly fixed costs (lean, Q1)** | $22K |
| **Break-even clients (Build tier)** | 3 clients at $10K/mo |
| **Break-even month** | **Month 1–2** (even 2 Build clients nearly covers costs) |
| **Comfortable runway (no revenue)** | Need $60K–$100K cash reserve |

**AfrexAI breaks even almost immediately** with the lean 2-person structure. The challenge isn't survival — it's scaling delivery capacity to match sales.

---

## 8. Scenario Analysis

### Conservative ($5M ARR by Dec)

| Assumption | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Monthly new deals (avg) | 3–4 |
| Total active customers (Dec) | 25 |
| Avg MRR/customer | $17K |
| Enterprise deals | 2–3 total |
| Close rate | 10–12% |

*What goes wrong:* Longer sales cycles, lower close rates, no enterprise deals until Q4. Still a great business.

### Moderate / Base Case ($11M ARR by Dec)

| Assumption | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Monthly new deals (avg) | 5–6 |
| Total active customers (Dec) | 49 |
| Avg MRR/customer | $19K |
| Enterprise deals | 8–10 total |
| Close rate | 15–20% |

*What needs to be true:* Cold email engine produces consistently, 2+ enterprise deals land by Q2, referrals kick in by Q3.

### Aggressive ($18M ARR by Dec)

| Assumption | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Monthly new deals (avg) | 8–10 |
| Total active customers (Dec) | 70+ |
| Avg MRR/customer | $22K |
| Enterprise deals | 15+ |
| Close rate | 20–25% |

*What needs to be true:* Partnership channel (SI/consulting) delivers 3+ deals/month, 2 enterprise whales ($50K+/mo), NRR >130%.

## 9. What Needs to Be True to Hit $11M

### The Math
- **$11M ARR = $917K MRR in December**
- At $19K avg MRR/customer → **~49 active customers**
- At 3.5% monthly churn → need **~58 total signed** (9 churned)
- Over 12 months → **~5 new customers per month average**
- At 15% close rate → **~33 qualified meetings per month**
- At 30% meeting-from-lead rate → **~110 qualified leads per month**
- At 3.5% cold email response rate → **~2,000 cold emails + inbound + referrals**

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Cold email engine at 2,000+/month by March** ✅ (already building)
2. **Land 2+ enterprise deals ($25K+/mo) by June** — Financial services or healthcare
3. **Maintain delivery quality** — Don't sign more than you can deliver (hire AI engineers in Apr/Jul)
4. **Build referral flywheel** — Every happy client should produce 1 warm intro per quarter
5. **Content/inbound generating 15+ leads/month by Q2** — LinkedIn, case studies, SEO
6. **Net Revenue Retention >110%** — Upsell Discovery → Build → Fractional systematically
7. **Don't underprice** — Resist discounting; value-based pricing from day 1
8. **Kalin stays in CTO/delivery role** — Don't get sucked into only selling; hire AE by July

## 10. Cash Flow Considerations

### Payment Terms
- **Discovery:** 100% upfront
- **Build:** Monthly retainer, net-15, or quarterly prepaid (offer 5% discount for annual prepay)
- **Fractional/Enterprise:** Monthly or quarterly, net-30

### Cash Flow Projection

| Month | Cash In | Cash Out | Net Cash | Cumulative Cash |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Jan | $15K | $22K | -$7K | -$7K |
| Feb | $30K | $22K | +$8K | +$1K |
| Mar | $55K | $22K | +$33K | +$34K |
| Apr | $100K | $47.5K | +$52.5K | +$86.5K |
| May | $135K | $47.5K | +$87.5K | +$174K |
| Jun | $225K | $47.5K | +$177.5K | +$351.5K |
| Jul | $330K | $86K | +$244K | +$595.5K |
| Aug | $450K | $86K | +$364K | +$959.5K |
| Sep | $570K | $98K | +$472K | +$1,431.5K |
| Oct | $740K | $127K | +$613K | +$2,044.5K |
| Nov | $900K | $145K | +$755K | +$2,799.5K |
| Dec | $920K | $145K | +$775K | **+$3,574.5K** |

**Key insight:** AfrexAI is cash-flow positive from Month 2. By December, there's $3.5M+ in the bank. This is a *capital-efficient* business — no fundraising needed.

### Risk: Late Payments
- Enterprise clients often pay net-60 in practice
- Build in 30-day buffer; actual cash may lag by $200K–$400K
- Offer 10% discount for annual prepayment to pull cash forward

## 11. Hiring Timeline

| When | Who | Cost/Mo | Why Now |
|------|-----|---------|---------|
| **Apr** | AI Engineer #1 | $10K | Can't deliver 10+ clients with just Kalin |
| **Jul** | Account Executive | $8K+comm | Free Kalin from selling; dedicated closer |
| **Jul** | AI Engineer #2 | $10K | 20+ clients need parallel delivery |
| **Sep** | Customer Success Manager | $7K | Retention critical; upsell engine |
| **Sep** | SDR | $5K+comm | Feed the AE; scale pipeline |
| **Nov** | AI Engineer #3 | $10K | 40+ clients, enterprise complexity |
| **Nov** | Ops/Project Manager | $8K | Process, SOWs, client comms at scale |

**End of 2026 team:** 9 people (Kalin, Christina, 3 engineers, 1 AE, 1 SDR, 1 CS, 1 PM)
**Total monthly payroll by Dec:** ~$145K (fully loaded)
**Revenue per employee:** ~$100K/month → **extremely capital efficient**

### Who NOT to Hire (Yet)
- ❌ Marketing lead (content can be AI-assisted + Christina)
- ❌ CFO (use fractional/contractor until $5M+ collected)
- ❌ HR (too early, outsource if needed)
- ❌ More AEs (prove the playbook with 1 first)

## 12. Key Metrics Dashboard

Track these weekly:

| Metric | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Cold emails sent | 2,000/mo | Weekly |
| Response rate | >3% | Weekly |
| Meetings booked | 30+/mo | Weekly |
| Close rate | >15% | Monthly |
| New MRR added | >$100K | Monthly |
| Monthly churn (revenue) | <3% | Monthly |
| NRR | >110% | Quarterly |
| CAC payback | <3 months | Quarterly |
| Gross margin | >75% | Monthly |
| Cash balance | Growing | Weekly |

---

## 13. Sensitivity Analysis

### What if close rate drops to 10%?
- Need 50 meetings/month instead of 33 → increase email volume to 3,000/mo
- Delays $11M by ~2 months (Feb 2027 instead of Dec 2026)

### What if average deal size is $12K/mo instead of $19K?
- Need 77 active customers instead of 49 → need more engineers, reach $11M by Q1 2027

### What if churn is 6% instead of 3.5%?
- Lose ~30% more revenue → need 7 deals/month → still achievable but tighter

### What if enterprise deals don't materialize?
- Build-only model: need 92 customers at $10K/mo → possible but requires 5+ engineers
- Still hit $7–8M ARR which is excellent

---

## TL;DR — The Path

1. **Q1:** Hustle. 2,000 cold emails/mo. Land 7 clients. Revenue: $100K.
2. **Q2:** Scale. First enterprise deal. Hire engineer. Revenue: $460K.
3. **Q3:** Systematize. Hire AE + engineer. Referrals flowing. Revenue: $1.35M.
4. **Q4:** Accelerate. 49 active clients. $920K MRR. **$11M ARR run rate.**

**Total cash collected in 2026: ~$4.5M**
**Total costs: ~$895K**
**Net profit: ~$3.6M**
**Team size by Dec: 9**
**No funding required.**
