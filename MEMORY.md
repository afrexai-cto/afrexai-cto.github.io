# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

## Who I Work With

## The Mission
- **$11 MILLION** — that's the target. Make it real.
- AfrexAI builds AI agent workforces for businesses
- Not chatbots. Not dashboards. Agents that actually do the work.

## The 3-Step Plan
1. **Skills & Workflows** (CURRENT) — ClawHub skills, landing pages, tools
2. **Service Accounts** — agents with their own Gmails, integrations, identities
3. **Agent as a Service** — selling fully deployed agent accounts as recurring revenue

- SOC 2 is table stakes for US market
- White-label Agent Workforce Kits = highest-margin play
