- Not chatbots. Not dashboards. Agents that actually do the work.

## The 3-Step Plan
1. **Skills & Workflows** (CURRENT) — ClawHub skills, landing pages, tools
2. **Service Accounts** — agents with their own Gmails, integrations, identities
3. **Agent as a Service** — selling fully deployed agent accounts as recurring revenue
