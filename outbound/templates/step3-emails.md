## Email 1: The Opener

Subject: 9 new employees, $12K/mo total

Hi {{first_name}},

What if you could add 9 employees tomorrow for $12K/mo total? No recruiting, no onboarding, no benefits packages.

That's what we're doing for operations teams right now. We deploy AI agents that handle the repetitive work your team does every day — data entry, report generation, customer follow-ups, compliance checks. The kind of work nobody wants to do but everybody needs done.

The agents run 24/7. They don't call in sick. And they cost about $1,300 per month each, fully managed.

We handle everything — deployment, monitoring, security, updates. Your team just sees the output.

I'd love to run a quick AI workforce audit for {{company}} to show you exactly which roles could be augmented or replaced. Takes 30 minutes and you'll walk away with a concrete savings number.

Worth a conversation?

## Email 2: The ROI Angle

Subject: quick math on {{company}}'s back-office costs

Hi {{first_name}},

I've been looking at companies similar to {{company}} and the pattern is always the same — 30-40% of back-office hours are spent on work that AI agents can do faster and cheaper.

One of our clients replaced their 6-person data processing team with 3 AI agents. Processing time went from 6 hours to 11 minutes. Annual savings came to $360K. Their investment was $54K for the year.

That's not a typo. That's a 567% ROI.

We deploy and manage the agents end-to-end. Your team doesn't touch infrastructure. You just get the results.

I'd like to show you what the numbers look like specifically for {{company}}. Thirty minutes, no pitch, just math.

Open to it?

## Email 3: The Pain Point

Subject: your team is doing work that machines should be doing

Hi {{first_name}},

I talk to operations leaders every week and I hear the same thing — their best people are stuck doing repetitive work because there's nobody else to do it.

The thing is, that work doesn't need a person anymore. Invoice processing, data validation, report generation, customer onboarding workflows — all of it can run on AI agents that work around the clock.

We're not talking about chatbots or basic automation. These are autonomous agents that handle complex, multi-step workflows end-to-end. And we manage the entire thing so your team doesn't have to become AI experts overnight.

Our clients typically see payback within 47 days. After that, it's pure margin.

I'd love to do a quick AI workforce audit for {{company}} — identify the highest-impact roles and show you exactly what the savings look like.

Does next Tuesday or Thursday work for a 30-minute call?

## Email 4: The Competitive Pressure

Subject: your competitors are already doing this

Hi {{first_name}},

I'll be direct — the companies in your space that are adopting AI agents right now are going to have a structural cost advantage within 12 months. The ones that wait will be playing catch-up.

We're deploying fully managed AI workforces for companies like {{company}}. Nine agents handling everything from data processing to compliance monitoring to customer operations. Fully hosted, fully managed. $12K/mo all-in.

The math is simple. If you're paying $60K per year for a role that an AI agent can do for $18K per year with no overhead, every month you wait costs you money.

I'm not trying to replace your team. I'm trying to free them up to do work that actually requires human judgment.

Can I show you what this looks like for {{company}}? Quick 30-minute call, I'll bring the numbers.

## Email 5: The Breakup

Subject: closing the loop

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple times about deploying AI agents for {{company}} and I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short.

If the timing isn't right, no hard feelings at all. But if reducing back-office costs by 60-70% while improving speed and accuracy is something that's on your radar for this year, I'd be happy to run a free 30-minute AI workforce audit whenever it makes sense.

We deploy everything, manage everything, and guarantee 99.9% uptime with an SLA. Your team just sees the results.

Either way, I'll stop filling your inbox. But the door's always open.

Best,

Kalin
CTO, AfrexAI
