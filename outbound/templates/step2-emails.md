## Template 1: The Time Question

**Subject:** How much of your team's week is just... process?

Hi {{firstName}},

I've been thinking about something. Most companies your size have smart, capable people spending a third of their week on tasks that don't require any judgment at all. Sorting emails, pulling reports, reconciling invoices, chasing follow-ups.

It's not that the work doesn't need to get done. It's that your team shouldn't be the ones doing it.

We deploy AI agents directly on your infrastructure — your cloud, your servers — that handle the repetitive stuff so your team can focus on the work that actually moves the business forward. We manage everything. You just see the results.

Would it make sense to do a quick audit of where your team's time is going? It takes about 30 minutes, and most companies find at least 80–100 hours a month they could get back.

## Template 2: The Hiring Alternative

**Subject:** Before you hire for that ops role

Hi {{firstName}},

I know this might sound forward, but if you're thinking about hiring someone to handle the growing volume of operational work at {{company}}, it might be worth a conversation first.

We work with companies in the 50–500 employee range that are hitting that inflection point where the operational load is growing faster than the team. The usual answer is to hire. The problem is that hiring takes months, costs six figures a year, and the work is often the kind of thing that burns people out fast.

The alternative we offer is AI agents deployed on your own infrastructure. They handle the repetitive, process-heavy tasks — document processing, email triage, reporting, scheduling — and we manage them end to end. Your data stays on your systems. We just keep the agents running and improving.

If you're open to it, I'd love to do a quick AI Workforce Audit — 30 minutes to map out where agents could have the most impact for your team.

## Template 3: The Competitor Angle

**Subject:** Something your competitors are starting to do

Hi {{firstName}},

I'll keep this short. We're seeing a pattern across mid-market companies right now: the ones that are pulling ahead operationally are deploying AI agents to handle the work that used to require headcount.

Not chatbots. Not basic automation. Actual agents that read documents, process data, draft communications, build reports, and coordinate workflows — running on the company's own infrastructure, managed by a team that knows what they're doing.

The companies that wait usually end up playing catch-up in 12–18 months when the efficiency gap becomes hard to ignore.

I'm not trying to create urgency for the sake of it. But if operational efficiency is on your radar at all, a 30-minute audit would show you exactly where the opportunities are.

Happy to set something up if you're interested: {{calendly_link}}

## Template 4: The Security-First Pitch

**Subject:** AI agents that run on your systems, not ours

Hi {{firstName}},

Most AI solutions ask you to send your data somewhere else. We think that's backwards.

We deploy AI agents directly on your infrastructure — your AWS account, your Azure tenant, your on-prem servers. Your data never leaves your environment. We manage the agents remotely, but everything they process stays with you.

The reason this matters is that mid-market companies like {{company}} often have compliance requirements or security concerns that make cloud-based AI tools a non-starter. Our model was built specifically for that situation.

If you've been interested in using AI to reduce operational overhead but hesitant about the data implications, this might be worth a conversation.

We start with a free AI Workforce Audit — 30 minutes to identify the highest-impact opportunities. No commitment, no pressure.

## Template 5: The Follow-Up / Breakup

**Subject:** Last one from me

Hi {{firstName}},

I sent a couple of notes about using AI agents to reduce operational overhead at {{company}} — agents that run on your infrastructure, managed by us.

I know timing is everything, and this might not be the right moment. Totally fine.

If it ever does become relevant — maybe when the ops workload gets heavier, or when a key person leaves and you're wondering how to cover the gap — the offer stands. A 30-minute AI Workforce Audit to map out where agents could save your team the most time.

No hard feelings if this isn't the right fit. I'll leave the link here just in case: {{calendly_link}}

All the best,
