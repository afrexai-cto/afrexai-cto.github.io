## Email 1: The Time Sink

Subject: the part of running agents nobody talks about

Hey {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company}} is working with AI agents. Nice. Most teams I talk to hit the same wall around month two — building and maintaining all the integrations their agents need to actually be useful.

We ran into the same thing running our own 9-agent swarm. So we started packaging the skills we built into standalone modules anyone running OpenClaw can install in minutes.

Things like CRM integrations, browser automation, report generation. Stuff that typically takes weeks to build properly.

Worth a look if you're tired of building plumbing instead of shipping features.

clawhub.dev has the full catalog.

Cheers,

## Email 2: The ROI Angle

Subject: quick math on custom vs pre-built

Hey {{firstName}},

Here's a number that keeps coming up in conversations with agent teams. It takes roughly 80-120 engineering hours to build a production-ready integration skill from scratch. At typical rates that's $15k-25k per skill.

We sell the same thing for $47-$247. Tested across thousands of hours of real agent operations.

Not trying to sell you something you don't need. But if your team is spending cycles building agent integrations instead of working on your actual product, there might be a faster path.

Happy to walk through what we've got if it's relevant.

## Email 3: The Social Proof

Subject: what 9 agents taught us about skills

Hey {{firstName}},

We run 9 autonomous agents in production at AfrexAI. Every day. Not demos, not prototypes. Real business operations.

Every skill we sell on ClawHub came from that environment. We built them because we needed them, tested them because our business depends on them, and now we sell them because other OpenClaw operators keep asking how we got our agents to do what they do.

If you're running OpenClaw or thinking about it, the catalog might save you a few months of trial and error.

clawhub.dev — take a look when you have a minute.

## Email 4: The Custom Angle

Subject: do you need something that doesn't exist yet

Hey {{firstName}},

Most of the skills on our ClawHub catalog started as custom builds. A customer needed their agents to do something specific, we built it, and then realized other teams needed the same thing.

If your agents need capabilities you can't find off the shelf, that's kind of our specialty. We scope it, build it, test it against our own swarm, and deliver something production-ready.

No minimum commitment. Just a conversation to see if it makes sense.

Would a 15-minute call be worth your time this week?

## Email 5: The Breakup

Subject: last one from me

Hey {{firstName}},

I've sent a couple of emails about pre-built skills for OpenClaw agents. I know inboxes are brutal so I'll keep this short and make it the last one.

If your team is building agent integrations from scratch and it's going great, ignore me completely. But if it's eating more engineering time than you expected, we've got a catalog of production-tested skills starting at $47.

clawhub.dev or just reply to this email. Either way, I'll stop filling your inbox.

All the best,
{{senderName}}
