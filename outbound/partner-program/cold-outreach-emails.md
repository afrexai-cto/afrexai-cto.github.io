## Template 1: For IT Consultancies

**Subject:** Quick question about your [INDUSTRY] clients

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I've been following [COMPANY]'s work helping mid-market companies with [SPECIFIC SERVICE — e.g., digital transformation, cloud migration]. Impressive client roster.

Quick question: are any of your clients asking about using AI to handle repetitive back-office work — data entry, document processing, customer support triage?

We built AfrexAI to deploy AI agent workforces that handle exactly those tasks. Think of it as adding 10 tireless employees to your client's team for a fraction of the cost.

We're launching a referral partner program — **15% recurring commission** on every deal you refer. No selling required. You introduce, we close.

A few of your peers are already earning $15-40K/year per referral just by making warm intros.

Worth a 15-minute call this week?

Best,

## Template 2: For MSPs

**Subject:** New revenue line for [COMPANY] — zero effort

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Managing IT for mid-market companies means you hear every pain point first. I'd bet at least a few clients have mentioned wanting to automate manual processes but don't know where to start.

That's where AfrexAI comes in. We deploy AI agent workforces — virtual workers that handle document processing, data extraction, customer comms, and back-office workflows. Your clients get the output of a 10-person team at 20% of the cost.

**Here's what's in it for [COMPANY]:**
- 15% recurring commission on every referred deal (avg. deal = $120K ACV → $18K/yr to you)
- Co-branded case studies to strengthen your client relationships
- Zero delivery burden — we handle onboarding, support, and success

You already have the trust. We have the product. Let's talk about putting them together.

Free for 15 minutes on [DAY]?

## Template 3: For BPO / Outsourcing Firms

**Subject:** AI agents + [COMPANY] = more margin, same clients

Hi [FIRST NAME],

This might sound counterintuitive — an AI company reaching out to an outsourcing firm — but hear me out.

Your clients at [COMPANY] outsource processes because they want cost efficiency and reliability. AI agents deliver even more of both. But here's the thing: **clients still need a human partner to manage the relationship, handle exceptions, and ensure quality.**

That's you.

We're seeing BPO partners use AfrexAI to:
- **Increase margin** by blending AI agents with human teams (AI handles 60-70% of volume)
- **Win new clients** by offering an "AI-augmented outsourcing" pitch competitors can't match
- **Earn 15% referral commission** on pure referrals where we handle delivery end-to-end

This isn't about replacing what you do. It's about making your offering 3x more competitive.

I'd love to show you how two of our BPO partners are structuring this. 20 minutes?
