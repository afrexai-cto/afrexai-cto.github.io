# Email Sequence: Construction

## Email 1 — Day 1: Introduction

**Subject:** {{firstName}}, your PMs are spending 50% of their time on paperwork

Hi {{firstName}},

Construction runs on communication — between site teams, subcontractors, clients, and suppliers. But most of that communication is manual, disorganised, and eats into time that should be spent building.

Project managers spend up to **50% of their time on admin**: chasing RFIs, updating reports, tracking compliance docs, and answering the same questions from different stakeholders.

At AfrexAI, we build custom AI assistants for construction companies that handle:

- **RFI & submittal management** — instant answers from project specs, drawings, and historical RFIs
- **Daily reporting** — AI-generated site reports from simple inputs
- **Safety & compliance** — instant access to RAMS, COSHH sheets, and regulatory requirements
- **Subcontractor communication** — automated scheduling, updates, and document requests
- **Project documentation search** — find anything across thousands of documents in seconds

Our construction clients see **40% reduction in PM admin time** and **60% faster document retrieval** within the first 90 days.

Worth 30 minutes to see how this fits {{companyName}}'s projects?

## Email 2 — Day 3: Value-Add

**Subject:** The £250K problem buried in your project admin

Hi {{firstName}},

Here's a number that should bother every construction MD:

A mid-size contractor running **5-10 active projects** typically has:

- **3-5 PMs** spending 20+ hrs/week on documentation and communication admin
- **£50,000-£80,000/year per PM** in salary — meaning **£75K-£200K/year** is going to paperwork, not project delivery
- **Average RFI response time: 7-10 days** (delays that cascade into programme overruns)
- **Document search time: 30-45 minutes** per query across fragmented systems

One of our clients — a £25M turnover contractor — deployed an AI assistant across their project teams. The result:

- RFI response time: **cut by 65%**
- Document retrieval: **45 minutes → 30 seconds**
- PM admin time: **reduced 18 hours/week across the team**
- Estimated annual savings: **£250,000+**

The AI doesn't replace your PMs — it turns them into project leaders instead of paper-pushers.

## Email 3 — Day 7: Case Study

**Subject:** How a £30M contractor eliminated project delays caused by information gaps

Hi {{firstName}},

Here's a case study that might hit close to home.

**The problem:** A regional contractor running 8 concurrent projects was haemorrhaging time on information retrieval. PMs were drowning in RFIs, subcontractors couldn't get timely answers, and compliance documentation was scattered across email, SharePoint, and filing cabinets. Two projects had overrun partly due to delayed RFI responses.

**What we built:** An AI assistant trained on their project specs, drawings, RAMS, and historical project data. Accessible to PMs, site managers, and subcontractors via web and mobile.

**The results (first 90 days):**
- RFI response time: **10 days → 3.5 days** (with 40% answered instantly by AI)
- Document search: **reduced from 35 minutes to under 1 minute**
- Daily report generation: **automated — saving 45 min/PM/day**
- Safety compliance queries: **resolved in seconds instead of calls to head office**
- PM admin time: **reduced 42%**
- Estimated annual savings: **£310,000**

Deployed in 5 weeks. Works alongside their existing project management tools.

I'd love to show you how this maps to {{companyName}}'s operations.

## Email 4 — Day 14: Breakup

**Subject:** Should I park this, {{firstName}}?

Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a few times about AI-powered project documentation and communication tools for construction firms. No reply — completely understand, you've got projects to run.

Before I step back, quick question: do any of these sound like {{companyName}}?

- ❌ PMs spending more time on admin than managing projects
- ❌ RFIs taking days when they should take hours
- ❌ Compliance docs scattered across 5 different systems
- ❌ Subcontractors chasing your team for information
- ❌ Knowledge walking out the door when experienced staff leave

If this isn't the right time, no problem — just let me know.

## Email 5 — Day 21: Final

**Subject:** Last email, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

This is my final message.

Construction is one of the least digitised industries in the world. The companies that change that first will win more projects, deliver faster, and retain better people.

AI isn't about replacing your team — it's about making sure your best people aren't wasted on tasks a machine can do in seconds.

If you ever want to explore what that looks like for {{companyName}}:
