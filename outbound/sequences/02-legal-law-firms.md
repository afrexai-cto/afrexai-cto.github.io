# Email Sequence: Legal / Law Firms

## Email 1, Day 1: Introduction

Subject: {{firstName}}, your associates are spending 60% of their time on non-billable work

Hi {{firstName}},

Here's a stat that keeps managing partners up at night: the average associate spends only 40% of their time on billable work. The rest? Document review, internal research, admin, chasing precedents across disorganised knowledge bases.

At AfrexAI, we build custom AI assistants specifically for law firms that handle legal research and precedent retrieval (instant answers from your firm's own case history and legal databases), document drafting and review (first drafts of contracts, briefs, and memos in minutes), client intake and matter management (automated questionnaires, conflict checks, and file setup), and knowledge management (your firm's collective expertise, searchable and always current).

Our legal clients typically see 30 to 50% more billable hours recovered per associate within the first quarter.

Worth 30 minutes to explore what this looks like for {{companyName}}?

## Email 2, Day 3: Value-Add

Subject: The £180K problem hiding in your firm's workflow

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick thought for you.

A 20-lawyer firm typically has associates spending 10 to 15 hours per week on internal research and document prep that doesn't directly bill. At an average associate cost of £60/hr, that's 15 hrs times £60 times 20 lawyers times 50 weeks, which equals £900,000 per year in non-billable associate time. Even recapturing 20% of that gives you £180,000 back into billable work or reduced overhead.

One firm we work with found that their AI assistant handled 70% of routine contract review. Catching clauses, flagging risks, suggesting edits. In the time it takes to make a coffee.

Their associates didn't lose jobs. They got promoted to higher-value work.

If you're curious how the numbers stack up for a firm like {{companyName}}, happy to walk through it.

## Email 3, Day 7: Case Study

Subject: How a 35-lawyer firm cut document review time by 75%

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick case study that might resonate.

The problem: A mid-size commercial law firm was losing competitive pitches because their turnaround times were too slow. Associates were buried in document review and precedent research. Partners were doing work below their pay grade.

What we built: An AI assistant trained on the firm's 15 years of case files, template library, and internal know-how. Integrated with their practice management system.

The results (first 90 days): Document first-draft time reduced 75%. Legal research per matter went from 4 hours to 45 minutes. Billable hours per associate increased 12 hours per week. Client turnaround time improved 60%. Estimated annual revenue impact: £420,000+.

The system was fully operational in 5 weeks. No workflow disruption. Full data security and confidentiality controls.

I can show you exactly how this maps to {{companyName}}'s practice areas.

## Email 4, Day 14: Breakup

Subject: Closing the loop, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

I've sent a few emails about how AI is helping law firms recover billable hours and speed up document workflows. I haven't heard back, which is completely fine. I know you're busy (you're a lawyer, after all).

Before I stop reaching out, let me ask: does any of this hit home? Associates drowning in document review instead of client work. Knowledge leaving the firm every time a senior lawyer exits. Slow turnaround costing you pitches and client satisfaction. Rising costs with no proportional increase in output.

If the timing is off, just say the word and I'll circle back next quarter.

Or if now works, 30 minutes here: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

## Email 5, Day 21: Final

Subject: Last note from me, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

This is my final email.

The legal industry is at an inflection point. Firms that integrate AI into their workflows now will have a structural advantage. Faster output, lower cost-per-matter, and the ability to do more with the same headcount.

The firms that wait will spend the next two years watching competitors win the same clients with half the turnaround time.

If you ever want to explore what AI could do for {{companyName}}, my door is open:
