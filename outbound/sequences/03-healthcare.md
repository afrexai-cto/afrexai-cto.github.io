# Email Sequence: Healthcare

## Email 1, Day 1: Introduction

Subject: {{firstName}}, your clinical staff shouldn't be doing data entry

Hi {{firstName}},

Healthcare professionals spend up to 35% of their day on administrative tasks. Documentation, patient queries, scheduling coordination, and insurance paperwork. That's time taken directly from patient care.

At AfrexAI, we build custom AI assistants for healthcare organisations that handle patient intake and triage (intelligent pre-screening, symptom assessment, and appointment routing), clinical documentation (AI-assisted notes, referral letters, and discharge summaries), patient communication (24/7 answers to FAQs about appointments, prescriptions, and procedures), and administrative workflow (insurance pre-authorisation, coding assistance, and scheduling optimisation).

Healthcare clients typically see a 45% reduction in administrative burden and 30% improvement in patient response times within 90 days.

Worth 30 minutes to explore how this could work at {{companyName}}?

## Email 2, Day 3: Value-Add

Subject: The hidden cost of your front desk

Hi {{firstName}},

Consider this: the average GP practice or clinic handles 150 to 300 patient calls per day. Most are routine. Appointment changes, prescription refills, test result queries, insurance questions.

Here's what that looks like financially. 3 front-desk staff handling calls equals around £90,000 per year in salary alone. Average call handle time is 4 to 6 minutes (much of it searching systems). 30% of calls are missed or go to voicemail during peak hours, and patients call back or switch providers.

One of our healthcare clients deployed an AI assistant that now handles 80% of routine patient queries instantly, 24/7, no hold times, no missed calls.

The result? They redeployed 2 admin staff to higher-value patient coordination roles and saw patient satisfaction scores jump 22%.

Happy to show you what the numbers would look like for {{companyName}}.

## Email 3, Day 7: Case Study

Subject: Case study: clinic reduced no-shows by 35% with AI

Hi {{firstName}},

Here's a real example that might be relevant for {{companyName}}.

The problem: A multi-site healthcare provider was struggling with high no-show rates (18%), overwhelmed front-desk staff, and clinicians spending excessive time on documentation. Patient complaints about wait times and accessibility were rising.

What we built: An AI assistant integrated with their EHR and booking system. It handled patient communications, pre-visit prep, post-visit follow-ups, and clinical documentation support.

The results (90 days): No-show rate went from 18% to 11.7% (35% reduction). Front-desk call volume reduced 65%. Clinical documentation time cut by 40%. Patient satisfaction (NPS) up 25 points. Estimated annual savings: £320,000. Clinician time recovered: 8 hours per week per provider.

Deployed in 6 weeks. Fully GDPR-compliant. Integrated with existing EHR, no system overhaul required.

I'd love to show you how this maps to {{companyName}}'s setup.

## Email 4, Day 14: Breakup

Subject: Should I step back, {{firstName}}?

Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a few times about AI solutions for healthcare admin and patient communication. I understand the healthcare world moves carefully, and it should.

Before I go quiet, here's a quick pulse check. If any of these sound familiar, one conversation could save you months of frustration: front desk overwhelmed with patients sitting on hold, clinicians spending more time on screens than patients, no-show rates eating into revenue, growing patient volume without proportional staff growth, or after-hours patient queries going completely unanswered.

If the timing is wrong, no worries at all. Just let me know and I'll check back in Q{{next_quarter}}.

## Email 5, Day 21: Final

Subject: Final note, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

Last email from me.

Healthcare is under more pressure than ever. More patients, tighter margins, staff shortages. The organisations investing in AI now aren't chasing trends; they're buying back capacity they desperately need.

In 18 months, AI-assisted patient communication and clinical documentation will be standard. The early movers will have better workflows, happier staff, and more loyal patients.

If you ever want to explore this for {{companyName}}, I'm here:
