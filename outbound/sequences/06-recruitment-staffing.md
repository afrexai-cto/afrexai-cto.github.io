# Email Sequence: Recruitment / Staffing

## Email 1, Day 1: Introduction

Subject: {{firstName}}, your recruiters are screening when they should be closing

Hi {{firstName}},

The average recruiter spends 65% of their time on non-revenue activities: sourcing, screening CVs, scheduling interviews, chasing candidates for updates, and answering the same client questions. That's time not spent placing candidates and billing fees.

At AfrexAI, we build custom AI assistants for recruitment and staffing firms that handle CV screening and shortlisting (AI that reads, ranks, and shortlists candidates against job specs in seconds), candidate communication (automated outreach, pre-screening questions, interview scheduling, and follow-ups), client reporting (instant pipeline updates, market insights, and progress summaries), knowledge base (your team's collective expertise on roles, markets, and clients, searchable instantly), and compliance and onboarding (automated right-to-work checks, reference chasing, and document collection).

Our recruitment clients typically see 50% faster time-to-shortlist and 35% more placements per recruiter within the first quarter.

Worth 30 minutes to see how this works for {{companyName}}?

## Email 2, Day 3: Value-Add

Subject: Your recruiters are leaving £200K+ on the table

Hi {{firstName}},

Let me put some numbers to the problem.

A recruitment firm with 10 consultants typically sees each recruiter handling 15 to 25 active roles simultaneously, spending 3 to 4 hours per day on CV screening, scheduling, and candidate chasing. 40% of candidates drop out due to slow communication. Average placement fee runs £8,000 to £15,000.

If each recruiter could make just 2 more placements per quarter by reclaiming admin time, that works out to 10 recruiters times 2 placements times 4 quarters times £10,000, which equals £800,000 per year in additional revenue. Even at a conservative estimate, that's £200,000+ in recovered billings.

One of our clients automated candidate screening and scheduling. Their recruiters went from spending 3 hours per day on admin to 45 minutes. Placements per head jumped 28% in one quarter.

## Email 3, Day 7: Case Study

Subject: How a 25-person agency increased placements by 32% without hiring

Hi {{firstName}},

Case study for you. Might hit close to home.

The problem: A specialist recruitment agency (25 consultants, 3 verticals) was hitting a ceiling. Consultants were maxed out on admin, screening hundreds of CVs per role, manually scheduling interviews, and spending hours on client reporting. They were losing candidates to faster-moving competitors. Growth meant hiring more recruiters at £45K+ each.

What we built: An AI assistant that screens and ranks CVs against job specs, handles candidate outreach and scheduling, generates client reports, and manages compliance document collection.

The results (90 days): CV screening time per role went from 3 hours to 15 minutes. Candidate response time went from 24 hours to instant. Interview scheduling fully automated (saving 6 hours per week per recruiter). Candidate drop-off rate reduced 40%. Placements per recruiter up 32%. Compliance processing 70% automated. Estimated annual revenue impact: £520,000+.

Deployed in 4 weeks. Integrated with their ATS and email. No workflow disruption.

I'd love to show you how this maps to {{companyName}}.

## Email 4, Day 14: Breakup

Subject: Should I close this out, {{firstName}}?

Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a few times about AI-powered recruitment automation for {{companyName}}. Haven't heard back. No worries, I know recruitment is relentless and your inbox probably looks like a warzone.

Quick check before I go. Any of these your reality? Recruiters drowning in CV screening instead of building relationships. Candidates ghosting because your process is too slow. Clients asking for pipeline updates you don't have time to compile. Compliance and onboarding paperwork eating billable hours. You need to grow revenue without growing headcount.

If now isn't right, just say so and I'll circle back next quarter.

## Email 5, Day 21: Final

Subject: Last one from me, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

Final email. I'll keep it short.

The recruitment firms winning right now aren't necessarily bigger. They're faster. Faster to screen, faster to respond, faster to place. AI is how they're doing it.

In 12 months, AI-assisted recruitment won't be a competitive advantage. It'll be the baseline. The firms building now will own the market.
