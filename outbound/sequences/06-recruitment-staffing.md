# Email Sequence: Recruitment / Staffing

## Email 1 — Day 1: Introduction

**Subject:** {{firstName}}, your recruiters are screening when they should be closing

Hi {{firstName}},

The average recruiter spends **65% of their time on non-revenue activities**: sourcing, screening CVs, scheduling interviews, chasing candidates for updates, and answering the same client questions. That's time not spent placing candidates and billing fees.

At AfrexAI, we build custom AI assistants for recruitment and staffing firms that handle:

- **CV screening & shortlisting** — AI that reads, ranks, and shortlists candidates against job specs in seconds
- **Candidate communication** — automated outreach, pre-screening questions, interview scheduling, and follow-ups
- **Client reporting** — instant pipeline updates, market insights, and progress summaries
- **Knowledge base** — your team's collective expertise on roles, markets, and clients, searchable instantly
- **Compliance & onboarding** — automated right-to-work checks, reference chasing, and document collection

Our recruitment clients typically see **50% faster time-to-shortlist** and **35% more placements per recruiter** within the first quarter.

Worth 30 minutes to see how this works for {{companyName}}?

## Email 2 — Day 3: Value-Add

**Subject:** Your recruiters are leaving £200K+ on the table

Hi {{firstName}},

Let me put some numbers to the problem.

A recruitment firm with **10 consultants** typically sees:

- Each recruiter handling **15-25 active roles** simultaneously
- **3-4 hours/day** spent on CV screening, scheduling, and candidate chasing
- **40% of candidates** dropping out due to slow communication
- Average placement fee: **£8,000-£15,000**

If each recruiter could make just **2 more placements per quarter** by reclaiming admin time, that's:

- **10 recruiters × 2 placements × 4 quarters × £10,000 = £800,000/year** in additional revenue
- Even at a conservative estimate, that's **£200,000+ in recovered billings**

One of our clients automated candidate screening and scheduling. Their recruiters went from spending 3 hours/day on admin to 45 minutes. Placements per head jumped **28%** in one quarter.

## Email 3 — Day 7: Case Study

**Subject:** How a 25-person agency increased placements by 32% without hiring

Hi {{firstName}},

Case study for you — might hit close to home.

**The problem:** A specialist recruitment agency (25 consultants, 3 verticals) was hitting a ceiling. Consultants were maxed out on admin — screening hundreds of CVs per role, manually scheduling interviews, and spending hours on client reporting. They were losing candidates to faster-moving competitors. Growth meant hiring more recruiters at £45K+ each.

**What we built:** An AI assistant that screens and ranks CVs against job specs, handles candidate outreach and scheduling, generates client reports, and manages compliance document collection.

**The results (90 days):**
- CV screening time per role: **3 hours → 15 minutes**
- Candidate response time: **24 hours → instant**
- Interview scheduling: **fully automated (saving 6 hrs/week per recruiter)**
- Candidate drop-off rate: **reduced 40%**
- Placements per recruiter: **up 32%**
- Compliance processing: **70% automated**
- Estimated annual revenue impact: **£520,000+**

Deployed in 4 weeks. Integrated with their ATS and email. No workflow disruption.

I'd love to show you how this maps to {{companyName}}.

## Email 4 — Day 14: Breakup

**Subject:** Should I close this out, {{firstName}}?

Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a few times about AI-powered recruitment automation for {{companyName}}. Haven't heard back — no worries, I know recruitment is relentless and your inbox probably looks like a warzone.

Quick check before I go. Any of these your reality?

- ❌ Recruiters drowning in CV screening instead of building relationships
- ❌ Candidates ghosting because your process is too slow
- ❌ Clients asking for pipeline updates you don't have time to compile
- ❌ Compliance and onboarding paperwork eating billable hours
- ❌ You need to grow revenue without growing headcount

If now isn't right, just say so and I'll circle back next quarter.

## Email 5 — Day 21: Final

**Subject:** Last one from me, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

Final email — I'll keep it short.

The recruitment firms winning right now aren't necessarily bigger. They're faster. Faster to screen, faster to respond, faster to place. AI is how they're doing it.

In 12 months, AI-assisted recruitment won't be a competitive advantage — it'll be the baseline. The firms building now will own the market.
