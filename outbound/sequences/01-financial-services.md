# Email Sequence: Financial Services

## Email 1 — Day 1: Introduction

**Subject:** {{firstName}}, AI is cutting compliance costs by 40% at firms like yours

Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{companyName}} is growing its {{department/service_line}} — congrats. With that growth usually comes a painful scaling problem: more client queries, more compliance paperwork, more hours burned on tasks that don't generate revenue.

At AfrexAI, we build custom AI assistants for financial services firms that handle:

- **Client onboarding & KYC** — automated document collection, verification, and flagging
- **Compliance Q&A** — instant, audit-ready answers from your own policy docs
- **Portfolio reporting** — natural-language summaries generated in seconds, not hours

Our financial services clients typically see a **40-60% reduction in back-office processing time** within the first 90 days.

Worth a 30-minute conversation to see if this fits {{companyName}}?

## Email 2 — Day 3: Value-Add

**Subject:** How one wealth manager saved 22 hours/week

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick follow-up — wanted to share something specific.

One of the biggest time drains we see at financial services firms is **repetitive client communication**: the same questions about account status, fee structures, document requests. Your team answers them manually, every single time.

Here's what that actually costs:

- A mid-size advisory firm with 500+ clients spends **~25 hours/week** on routine queries
- At a blended rate of £80/hr, that's **£104,000/year** in labor on questions an AI could handle instantly
- One of our clients automated 85% of these and **redeployed 2 FTEs to revenue-generating work**

The AI doesn't replace your advisors — it gives them their time back.

If that resonates, I'd love to show you exactly how it works for firms like {{companyName}}.

## Email 3 — Day 7: Case Study

**Subject:** Case study: {{similar_company_type}} cut client response time from 48hrs to 2min

Hi {{firstName}},

Thought this might be relevant for {{companyName}}.

**The problem:** A UK-based wealth management firm was drowning in client requests — KYC updates, portfolio questions, compliance queries. Response times averaged 48 hours. Client satisfaction was slipping.

**What we built:** A secure AI assistant trained on their internal docs, compliance frameworks, and client data. Integrated with their CRM and document management system.

**The results (90 days):**
- Client response time: **48 hours → 2 minutes**
- KYC processing: **70% faster**
- Compliance review prep: **reduced from 3 days to 4 hours**
- Client NPS score: **increased 18 points**
- Estimated annual savings: **£285,000**

The entire system was deployed in 6 weeks with zero disruption to their existing workflows.

I can walk you through exactly how this would map to {{companyName}}'s setup.

## Email 4 — Day 14: Breakup

**Subject:** Should I close your file, {{firstName}}?

Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a couple of times about how AI assistants are helping financial services firms cut costs and improve client experience. Haven't heard back, so I want to be respectful of your time.

Totally possible this isn't a priority right now — no hard feelings.

But if any of these sound familiar, it might be worth one conversation:

- ❌ Your team spends more time on admin than advising clients
- ❌ Compliance prep eats entire weeks before audits
- ❌ Client queries pile up and response times are slipping
- ❌ You're hiring more ops staff just to keep up

If now isn't the right time, just let me know and I'll follow up in a few months instead.

## Email 5 — Day 21: Final

**Subject:** Last one from me, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

This is my last email — I promise.

I'll leave you with this: the financial services firms that are adopting AI now aren't doing it because it's trendy. They're doing it because their competitors are, and in 12 months, the gap between AI-enabled firms and everyone else will be impossible to ignore.

If that changes your calculus, my calendar is always open:

Wishing {{companyName}} continued success either way.
