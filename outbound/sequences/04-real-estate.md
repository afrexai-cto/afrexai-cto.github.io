# Email Sequence: Real Estate

## Email 1 — Day 1: Introduction

**Subject:** {{firstName}}, your agents are losing deals to slow response times

Hi {{firstName}},

In real estate, speed wins. The first agent to respond to an enquiry is **78% more likely to win the listing or close the buyer**. Yet most agencies take 6-24 hours to reply to website and portal leads.

At AfrexAI, we build custom AI assistants for real estate businesses that handle:

- **Instant lead response** — every Rightmove, Zoopla, or website enquiry answered in under 60 seconds, 24/7
- **Property matching & recommendations** — AI that understands buyer criteria and surfaces the right listings instantly
- **Viewing scheduling** — automated booking, confirmation, and follow-up without agent involvement
- **Landlord & tenant communication** — routine queries about maintenance, contracts, and payments handled automatically
- **Market analysis** — instant comparable reports and area insights for valuations

Our real estate clients see **50-70% of routine enquiries handled without agent involvement** and a **35% increase in booked viewings** within the first 60 days.

Worth a 30-minute chat to see how this fits {{companyName}}?

## Email 2 — Day 3: Value-Add

**Subject:** You're probably losing 40% of your leads right now

Hi {{firstName}},

Here's the brutal reality for most estate agencies:

- **Average lead response time:** 4-8 hours (evenings and weekends? Forget it)
- **Lead conversion rate** after 30 minutes: drops by **21x**
- **Weekend/evening enquiries** (40% of all leads): mostly unanswered until Monday morning

For a mid-size agency generating **200 leads/month**, that means roughly **80 leads are going cold** before an agent even looks at them. At an average commission of £3,500, even converting **5 more deals/month** = **£210,000/year in additional revenue**.

One of our clients — a 3-branch agency — deployed an AI assistant that responds to every enquiry in under 30 seconds, qualifies the lead, and books viewings automatically.

Result: **28% more viewings booked**, **15% increase in instructions**, and agents freed from phone tag to focus on closing.

Want to see what those numbers look like for {{companyName}}?

## Email 3 — Day 7: Case Study

**Subject:** How a regional agency added £380K in revenue with AI

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick case study for you.

**The problem:** A 4-branch estate agency was losing leads to faster-responding online competitors. Agents were spending 60% of their time on admin — answering the same questions, chasing viewings, updating landlords. Weekend coverage was thin.

**What we built:** An AI assistant handling inbound enquiries across all channels (portals, website, email, WhatsApp), with automated viewing scheduling, property matching, and tenant/landlord FAQ handling.

**The results (90 days):**
- Lead response time: **8 hours → 27 seconds**
- Viewings booked: **+35%**
- New instructions: **+18%**
- Agent admin time: **reduced 55%**
- Tenant query resolution (lettings): **80% automated**
- Estimated annual revenue impact: **£380,000+**

Deployed in 4 weeks. Integrated with their existing CRM and portal feeds.

I can walk you through how this would work for {{companyName}}'s setup.

## Email 4 — Day 14: Breakup

**Subject:** Closing this one out, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

I've sent a few messages about AI-powered lead response and admin automation for estate agencies. Haven't heard back — totally fine, I know the market keeps you busy.

Quick gut check before I go. Any of these ring true?

- ❌ Leads from portals going cold because agents can't respond fast enough
- ❌ Evenings and weekends are a black hole for enquiries
- ❌ Agents buried in admin instead of out winning instructions
- ❌ Lettings team overwhelmed with repetitive tenant queries
- ❌ Competitors responding faster and winning your business

If the timing's off, just say so — I'll check back later.

## Email 5 — Day 21: Final

**Subject:** Last one, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

Final email from me.

The agencies that are winning right now have one thing in common: they respond faster than everyone else. AI makes that possible at a fraction of the cost of hiring more staff.

In a year, instant AI response will be table stakes. The agencies building this now will have the data, the reviews, and the market share.

If you ever want to explore it for {{companyName}}:
