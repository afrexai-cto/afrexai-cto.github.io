## Notes

Prioritize Tier 1 and Tier 3. Consultancies spot pain points; BPOs can co-sell or white-label AI agents alongside their human workforce. MSPs (Tier 2) are best approached with a "value-add to your managed services stack" angle. All contacts should be verified via LinkedIn before outreach. Commission: 15% of first-year ACV, paid quarterly. See partner program docs for full terms.
