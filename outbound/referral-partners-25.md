## Notes

- **Prioritize Tier 1 & Tier 3** — consultancies spot pain points; BPOs can co-sell or white-label AI agents alongside their human workforce.
- **MSPs (Tier 2)** are best approached with a "value-add to your managed services stack" angle.
- All contacts should be verified via LinkedIn before outreach.
- Commission: 15% of first-year ACV, paid quarterly. See partner program docs for full terms.
