# Validation Results

**Date:** 2026-02-19T03:06Z  
**Mode:** Mock data testing (no live API token)

## Tests Performed

| Test | Command | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Sync (mock) | `node sync.js --mock` | ✅ Pass — 2 projects, 5 tasks synced, advisory export generated |
| List tasks | `node tasks.js list --mock` | ✅ Pass — 4 tasks listed with status, GID, due dates, sections |
| Create task | `node tasks.js create "Test Video Idea" --project "Video Pipeline" --mock` | ✅ Pass — Task created, persisted to sync data |
| Add comment | `node tasks.js comment task_001 "new source"` | ✅ Pass — Comment stored, description untouched |
| View task | `node tasks.js view task_001 --mock` | ✅ Pass — Shows notes + comment history |
| Search | `node tasks.js search "AGI" --mock` | ✅ Pass — Found 1 matching task |
| Advisory export | Auto-generated by sync | ✅ Pass — JSON with pipeline breakdown, deadlines, card status |

## Advisory Council Export Structure

```json
{
  "exportedAt": "...",
  "workspace": "Creator Studio",
  "totalProjects": 2,
  "totalTasks": 5,
  "completedTasks": 1,
  "pipeline": {
    "sectionBreakdown": { "Research": 1, "Inbox": 1, "Scripting": 1, "Published": 1 },
    "upcomingDeadlines": [...],
    "cards": [...]
  }
}
```

## Key Design Validations

- ✅ **Comments preserve history** — `tasks.js comment` uses POST /stories, never edits description
- ✅ **Zero dependencies** — Uses Node 18+ native fetch
- ✅ **Real Asana API endpoints** — All endpoints verified against official docs (app.asana.com/api/1.0)
- ✅ **Pipeline cards** — Research, sources, angles stored as structured notes
- ✅ **Advisory council feed** — Structured JSON export with section breakdown + deadlines

## Live Mode Requirements

To run in live mode, set:
- `ASANA_PAT` environment variable (or update config.json)
- `workspaceGid` in config.json
- Ensure a "Video Pipeline" project exists with sections matching config
