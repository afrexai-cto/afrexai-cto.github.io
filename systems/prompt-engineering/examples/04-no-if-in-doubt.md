# Principle: No "If In Doubt" Defaults

## Before
```
Tools available:
- search: Search the web. If you're not sure about something, use this.
- calculator: Do math. When in doubt, use the calculator.
```

## After
```
Tools available:
- search: Search the web. Use for questions about current events, prices, live data, or facts you don't have training data for.
- calculator: Compute arithmetic. Use for multi-step calculations, percentages, or unit conversions where precision matters.
```

## Why
"If not sure" is a huge trigger surface — the model is "not sure" about a lot of things. Specific conditions mean the tool fires when it should and stays quiet when it shouldn't.
