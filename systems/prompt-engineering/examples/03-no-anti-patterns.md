# Principle: Only Show Desired Behavior

## Before
```
When summarizing, don't do this:
"The article talks about many things including AI and also discusses some aspects of machine learning and there are several points about data."

Instead, do this:
"The article covers three advances in ML: federated learning, sparse attention, and RLHF fine-tuning."
```

## After
```
When summarizing, be specific and structured:

"The article covers three advances in ML: federated learning, sparse attention, and RLHF fine-tuning."
```

## Why
The model reads the bad example and internalizes its patterns — vague language, filler words, lack of structure. Even when told "don't do this," the example primes the model. Removing it entirely eliminates the risk.
