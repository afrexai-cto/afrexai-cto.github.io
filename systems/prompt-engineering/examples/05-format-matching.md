# Principle: Match Prompt Format to Output Format

## Before (wants casual chat, writes formally)
```
## Instructions
- Respond conversationally
- Do not use bullet points
- Do not use headers
- Keep tone informal and warm
```

## After
```
Talk like you're texting a friend. No lists, no headers, just normal sentences. Keep it warm and casual — imagine you're explaining something over coffee.
```

## Why
The "before" prompt uses headers, bullets, and formal structure — then asks for the opposite. The model picks up on formatting cues from the prompt itself. Write the prompt in the style you want the output to be.
