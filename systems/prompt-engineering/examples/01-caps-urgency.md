# Principle: No ALL-CAPS Urgency Markers

## Before
```
You are a customer support agent. You MUST ALWAYS greet the customer first.
NEVER share internal pricing. CRITICAL: Do NOT mention competitor products.
You MUST ALWAYS ask for their order number.
```

## After
```
You are a customer support agent. Start each conversation with a greeting, then ask for their order number — this helps you pull up their account quickly.

Keep internal pricing and competitor products out of the conversation. Customers get confused when they see numbers that don't match their invoice, and mentioning competitors derails the support flow.
```

## Why
The "before" version has 5 maximum-priority instructions. The model can't distinguish what actually matters. The "after" version reads naturally and the reasoning helps the model make good judgment calls in edge cases.
