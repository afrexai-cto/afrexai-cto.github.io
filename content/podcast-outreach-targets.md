**Subject:** Guest pitch: AI agents replacing legacy compliance platforms — real ROI data

**Body:**
Hi [Host name],

I'm Christina Beckford, CEO of AfrexAI. We build AI agent workforces for financial services — the companies replacing WorkFusion and manual compliance processes.

I'd love to share real data on [podcast name]:
- Why 95% of AI pilots fail in compliance (and what the 5% do differently)
- The WorkFusion exodus: what banks are switching to and why
- Colorado AI Act + Basel III.1: the regulatory double squeeze hitting compliance teams

I can bring concrete ROI numbers — not theory. Happy to share a one-pager.

Best,
Christina
