# LinkedIn Post — HHS AI Governance Deadline
*Draft: 2026-02-18 | For AfrexAI company page | ~200 words*

April 3, 2026.

That's the deadline HHS just set for all divisions to adopt AI governance practices — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security controls, human oversight.

Every hospital and health system in the US is now scrambling to figure out what "AI governance" actually looks like in practice.

Here's the thing most people miss:

Governance without implementation is just paperwork.

You can write the prettiest AI policy document in the world. But if you don't have working AI agents actually handling clinical documentation, claims processing, or patient scheduling — what are you governing?

The hospitals getting this right (CHOP, Tampa General, Fred Hutch) didn't start with governance frameworks. They started with working AI. Then they built governance around real systems doing real work.

The order matters.

If your AI governance plan is a binder on a shelf, April 3 is going to be a very uncomfortable day.

If it's built around AI agents that are already in production, monitored, and auditable — you're already compliant.

We help health systems go from "AI strategy deck" to "AI agents in production" in 30 days.

DM if April 3 is keeping you up at night.
