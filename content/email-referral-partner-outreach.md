# Referral Partner Outreach — Boutique Consultancies
Created: 2026-02-14 | For Christina to send from ksmolichki@afrexai.com

## Target Profile

Boutique management/IT consultancies with 5-50 people that serve mid-market firms in legal, financial services, or healthcare. They already advise on digital transformation but don't have AI implementation capability. We become their AI delivery arm — they keep the client relationship.

## Terms to Propose

15% revenue share on referred deals for 12 months. Co-branded delivery where they keep the relationship and we provide the AI agents. No upfront cost, no commitment — pure upside for them.

## Email 1: Initial Outreach

Subject options:
A) Partnership idea — AI delivery for your clients
B) Quick question about [Firm Name]'s AI strategy
C) Adding $200K+ revenue to [Firm Name] without hiring

Body:

Hi [First Name],

I came across [Firm Name] while researching consultancies doing great work in [legal tech / financial services transformation / healthcare operations].

Quick context: we're AfrexAI. We build and manage AI agent workforces for mid-market firms — think document review automation for law firms, compliance screening for banks, clinical documentation for health systems. The kind of stuff that takes 6 months to build in-house, we deploy in weeks.

Here's why I'm reaching out: most of your clients are probably asking about AI. And most consultancies we talk to say the same thing — they can advise on strategy, but implementation is a different beast.

We could fix that. Simple referral partnership: you introduce us to clients who need AI implementation, we handle delivery end-to-end, and you earn 15% of contract value for 12 months.

No cost, no commitment. If a client doesn't close, you're out nothing.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: Follow-up (Day 4, if no reply)

Subject: Re: Partnership idea — AI delivery for your clients

Hi [First Name],

Just floating this back up. One number that might help:

Our last legal client saved $2.4M annually on document review alone. That was a $250K engagement — the ROI sells itself.

For you, that's $37,500 in referral fees from a single introduction. We handle everything post-intro.

Happy to send a one-pager with case examples if that's easier than a call.

## Email 3: Break-up (Day 10, if no reply)

Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short — I reached out about a referral partnership where [Firm Name] could earn 15% on AI implementations we deliver to your clients.

If the timing's off, no worries at all. But if any of your clients mention AI this quarter (and they will), feel free to loop me in. The offer stands.

All the best,
Christina

## Target Consultancies to Research

1. Legal tech advisors — firms advising Am Law 101-200 on operations/tech
2. Financial services consultancies — compliance/risk advisory boutiques
3. Healthcare IT consultancies — EHR implementation, revenue cycle firms
4. Digital transformation boutiques — generalists who need an AI delivery partner
5. Fractional CTO/CIO firms — they advise but don't build

Next step: Research 5 specific firms by name and find decision-makers.
