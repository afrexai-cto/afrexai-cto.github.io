## Email 1: The Problem (Day 1)

**Subject:** Your compliance team is scaling linearly. Your risk isn't.

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: how many SAR filings did {{company}} process last quarter vs. two years ago?

For most firms your size, the answer is "way more" — but the team handling them hasn't grown to match.

We build AI agent workforces that handle the repetitive compliance work (screening, monitoring, doc review) so your team focuses on judgment calls. One client cut manual review time by 73% in 90 days.

Worth a 15-minute chat to see if this fits?

## Email 2: Social Proof (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Your compliance team is scaling linearly

Hi {{first_name}},

Forgot to mention — Klarna deployed AI agents and saved $60M while cutting resolution time from 11 minutes to 2. That's not a typo.

We do the same thing for compliance teams specifically. Not chatbots. Working agents that file SARs, screen transactions, and flag anomalies.

If {{company}} is dealing with rising compliance costs, I can show you exactly how this works in 15 minutes.

## Email 3: Insight (Day 7)

**Subject:** 95% of AI pilots fail. Here's why yours won't.

Hi {{first_name}},

MIT found 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail. The reason is always the same: companies buy software and expect it to work on its own.

We're not software. We build, deploy, and manage AI agent workforces end-to-end. Your team doesn't learn a new tool — they get results.

That's why our clients stay (95%+ retention).

15 minutes this week?

## Email 4: Competitor/FOMO (Day 14)

**Subject:** Your competitors are already doing this

Hi {{first_name}},

Two of the largest {{vertical_segment}} firms are actively piloting AI compliance agents right now. Not "exploring" — deploying.

The gap between firms that automate compliance and those that don't is about to get very visible to regulators and clients.

Happy to share what we're seeing in the market. No pitch — just intel.

## Email 5: Breakup (Day 21)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times — totally understand if the timing isn't right.

If compliance automation becomes a priority at {{company}}, I'm easy to find. We'll still be here turning 3-person compliance teams into forces that punch like 15.

All the best,
Christina
