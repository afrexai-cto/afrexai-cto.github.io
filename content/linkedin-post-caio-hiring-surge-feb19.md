The Chief AI Officer is no longer optional.

New data from Longhouse shows more than a third of all CAIO appointments happened in the last 4 months alone. November 2025 to February 2026 — a hiring surge.

Here's what that tells us:

→ Boards are done with "AI strategy" PowerPoints
→ They want someone accountable for results
→ And that someone is walking into a minefield of stalled pilots and vendor fatigue

The uncomfortable truth: most of these new CAIOs are inheriting 2-3 failed AI experiments and a skeptical C-suite.

They don't need another platform demo. They need someone who can take what's half-built and make it work.

That's the real opportunity in enterprise AI right now. Not selling new tools. Finishing what's already started.

If you're one of those newly appointed AI leaders — what's the first project you're tackling?

## Notes
- No direct AfrexAI pitch — pure thought leadership
- Engagement hook at the end (question)
- Positions AfrexAI's value prop implicitly: "finishing what's started"
