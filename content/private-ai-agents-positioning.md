# Private AI Agents: The Enterprise Standard

*AfrexAI Positioning Document — For firms with strict AI policies*

---

## The Problem Every Law Firm Has

Your firm banned ChatGPT. Smart move — client confidentiality isn't negotiable.

But now you're watching competitors automate contract review, due diligence, and document drafting while your associates spend 60% of their time on work a machine could do better.

**The choice isn't AI vs. no AI. It's managed AI vs. falling behind.**

## What "Private AI Agents" Means

Unlike public AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini), AfrexAI deploys **private, managed AI agents** that:

- **Run inside your infrastructure** — no data leaves your environment
- **Never train on your data** — zero model contamination, ever
- **Comply with your existing AI policy** — we configure to your rules, not ours
- **Are auditable** — every action logged, every decision traceable
- **Are managed by humans** — our team monitors, tunes, and improves continuously

## How It Works

| Public AI Tools | AfrexAI Private Agents |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Your data goes to their servers | Agents run in your cloud/on-prem |
| Model trains on your inputs | Zero data retention, zero training |
| One-size-fits-all | Configured for your practice areas |
| You figure it out | We manage everything |
| No audit trail | Full logging + compliance reports |
| IT liability | Covered under our SOC 2 + BAA |

## Use Cases That Pay for Themselves

### Contract Review Agent
- Reviews 200+ page agreements in 12 minutes (vs. 4-6 associate hours)
- Flags non-standard clauses, missing provisions, risk areas
- **ROI:** 1 agent replaces ~$180K/yr in associate review time

### Due Diligence Agent
- Processes data rooms 10x faster than manual review
- Cross-references findings across documents automatically
- **ROI:** Reduces DD timelines from weeks to days

### Document Drafting Agent
- Generates first drafts from templates + deal terms
- Learns your firm's style, precedent, and preferences
- **ROI:** Associates spend time on strategy, not formatting

### Compliance Monitoring Agent
- Continuous regulatory scanning across jurisdictions
- Auto-flags changes that affect active matters
- **ROI:** Eliminates missed regulatory updates entirely

## The "No Public AI" Angle

**For firms that have banned public AI tools, this is your pitch:**

> "You made the right call restricting public AI — your clients' data is too valuable to risk. But your competitors aren't waiting. Private AI agents give you the productivity gains without the confidentiality risk. Every agent runs inside your walls, never sees the internet, and follows your policies to the letter."

## Pricing (Typical Engagement)

| Phase | Duration | Investment |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Discovery & PoC | 2-4 weeks | $25K-$50K |
| Pilot (1 practice area) | 6-8 weeks | $80K-$120K |
| Full deployment | Ongoing | $15K-$30K/month |
| **Year 1 total** | | **$200K-$450K** |

**ROI payback:** Typically 3-4 months after deployment.

## Objection Handling

**"We already have Microsoft Copilot."**
Copilot is a general tool. Our agents are built for legal workflows — they understand precedent, jurisdiction, and your firm's specific practices. Copilot assists. Our agents execute.

**"We're worried about accuracy."**
Every agent output includes confidence scoring and source citations. Human review is built into the workflow — agents augment, they don't replace. Error rates are tracked and reported monthly.

**"Our partners won't adopt it."**
We start with associates and paralegals — the people drowning in repetitive work. Partners see the output quality improve and timelines shrink. Adoption follows results.

**"What about ethical obligations?"**
We've mapped our deployment model against ABA Formal Opinion 512 (AI in legal practice). Private deployment + audit trails + human oversight = full compliance with duty of competence and confidentiality.
