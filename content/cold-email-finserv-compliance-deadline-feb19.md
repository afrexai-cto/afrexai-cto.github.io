## Email Body

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: how's your team handling the overlap of Basel III.1 prep, SEC AI disclosure requirements, and the usual AML/KYC workload?

Most mid-market financial services firms I talk to are drowning. The compliance burden grew 30% last year while headcount stayed flat. Something has to give.

We build AI agents that actually do the work — not dashboards, not chatbots. Real automation:

- **KYC/AML screening** that runs continuously, not in batches
- **Regulatory filing prep** that takes hours instead of weeks  
- **Risk monitoring** that catches anomalies your team would miss at 2am

One client saved $60K/quarter by automating their compliance document review alone. And that was a 3-week implementation.

I'd love to show you a 15-minute demo specific to [COMPANY_TYPE — wealth management / banking / insurance]. No slides, just working agents.

Worth a look?

Best,
Christina Beckford

P.S. We're seeing firms that move first on compliance automation lock in 18-24 month advantages over competitors. The regulatory window doesn't stay open forever.
