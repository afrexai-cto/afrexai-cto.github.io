# AfrexAI — Legal AI Agents
## Your AI Workforce, Managed

---

### The Problem
- Associate salaries hit **$225K+** at AmLaw 200 firms. Clients refuse to pay junior associate rates for document review.
- **90% of small businesses** need legal help — only 20% can afford it. Massive unmet demand.
- Regulatory complexity is growing 3x faster than firm headcount can scale.
- The billable hour model is dying. Clients demand fixed-fee, outcome-based pricing. Firms that can't deliver efficiency will lose.

### What We Do
We deploy **managed AI agents** that handle the work associates shouldn't be billing for:

| Agent | What It Does | Typical Impact |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Contract Review** | Clause extraction, risk flagging, deviation analysis | 80% faster review cycles |
| **Legal Research** | Case law analysis, precedent identification, memo drafting | 60% reduction in research time |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Regulatory change tracking, impact assessment, alert routing | Real-time vs. quarterly updates |
| **Document Drafting** | Template generation, first-draft creation from deal terms | 50% faster document turnaround |
| **Due Diligence** | Data room analysis, red flag identification, summary reports | 70% faster DD cycles |

### Why AfrexAI
- **Not a chatbot.** Purpose-built agents that integrate into your matter management and DMS.
- **Managed end-to-end.** We build, deploy, monitor, and improve. No need to hire an AI team.
