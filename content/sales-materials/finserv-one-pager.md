# AfrexAI — Financial Services AI Agents
## Your AI Workforce, Managed

---

### The Problem
- KYC/AML compliance costs hit $61B globally in 2025. Still rising.
- Manual onboarding takes 24-90 days. Clients leave before you finish.
- Basel III.1 and SEC AI disclosure rules add more reporting burden in 2026.
- 40% of compliance analyst time goes to false positive alerts. That's waste.

### What We Do
We deploy **managed AI agents** that handle the work your team shouldn't be doing manually:

| Agent | What It Does | Typical Impact |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **KYC/AML Screening** | Automated customer due diligence, sanctions matching | 70% faster onboarding |
| **Transaction Monitoring** | Pattern detection, false positive triage | 50-60% fewer false alerts |
| **Regulatory Reporting** | Auto-compilation of Basel, MiFID, SEC filings | 80% less manual prep |
| **Document Processing** | Loan apps, account opening, contract extraction | 3x throughput |
| **Risk Assessment** | Credit scoring augmentation, portfolio monitoring | 30% faster decisions |

### Why AfrexAI
- **Not a platform.** Production-ready agents deployed in weeks, not quarters.
