Your inbox is full of vendors promising "autonomous AI agents" that'll transform your business. Most of them are lying. Not maliciously — they just can't deliver what they're selling.

Here's how to separate the real from the hype before you sign a $200K contract.

## The Problem Nobody Talks About

60% of enterprise companies are now hiring Chief AI Officers. Law firms, healthcare systems, financial services — everyone wants in. But here's the dirty secret: **most AI agent deployments fail in the first 90 days.**

Not because the technology doesn't work. Because the vendor sold you a platform when you needed an outcome.

## Platform vs. Service: The First Decision

There are two ways to buy AI agents:

**Platform (DIY):** You get software. You build the agents yourself. Think Relevance AI, CrewAI, or Lindy. Pricing starts cheap ($30-350/month), but your team spends 3-6 months building, debugging, and maintaining. Real cost? $50K-$150K in employee time.

**Managed Service (Done-for-you):** Someone builds, deploys, and maintains your agents. You pay more upfront ($1,500-$5,000/month) but get results in weeks, not quarters. The vendor owns the outcome, not just the license.

Neither is universally better. But if your team doesn't include ML engineers who've shipped production AI systems, you want managed. Full stop.

## 7 Questions to Ask Every AI Agent Vendor

Before your next demo, ask these. The answers will tell you everything.

### 1. "Show me an agent running in production right now."
Not a demo environment. Production. With real data. If they can't, they're selling futures.

### 2. "What happens when the agent makes a mistake?"
Every agent will hallucinate, misclassify, or fail eventually. You want: human-in-the-loop escalation, audit trails, and rollback capability. If they say "our agents don't make mistakes" — run.

### 3. "What's your total cost of ownership over 12 months?"
Include: license fees, implementation, training, API costs (LLM usage adds up fast), maintenance, and the internal team time required. A $2,000/month tool that needs a full-time engineer to babysit is actually a $15,000/month tool.

### 4. "Can I see your security architecture?"
AI agents that touch sensitive data (legal documents, patient records, financial transactions) need: SOC 2, data encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access, and clear data retention policies. If they dodge this question, your CISO will kill the deal anyway.

### 5. "What integrations are native vs. custom?"
"We integrate with everything" means "we integrate with nothing well." Ask specifically about YOUR stack: your CRM, your document management system, your ERP. Custom integrations add 2-6 months and $20K-$50K.

### 6. "What's your average time to value?"
Good vendors measure this. Great vendors guarantee it. If they can't answer with a specific number ("42 days average for legal doc review agents"), they haven't deployed enough to know.

### 7. "Who else in my industry uses this?"
References in YOUR vertical matter more than total customer count. An AI agent that works for e-commerce doesn't automatically work for healthcare compliance. Ask for 2-3 references you can actually call.

## The Vendor Red Flag Checklist

Walk away if you see three or more:

- ❌ "Our AI replaces your entire team"
- ❌ No production customer references in your industry
- ❌ Pricing requires annual commitment before pilot
- ❌ Can't explain how the agent handles edge cases
- ❌ "We use proprietary AI" (translation: GPT wrapper with a markup)
- ❌ Implementation timeline is "it depends"
- ❌ No clear SLA on agent accuracy or uptime

## What Good Looks Like

The vendors worth your time will:

- **Start with a pilot** — 30-60 days, specific use case, measurable success criteria
- **Show you the math** — "This agent will process X documents/day at Y accuracy, saving Z hours"
- **Own the outcome** — Fixed-price implementation, performance guarantees, skin in the game
- **Know your industry** — They've solved YOUR type of problem before, with specifics
- **Be honest about limitations** — "Here's what AI agents can't do yet in your domain"

## The Bottom Line

AI agents are real. The ROI is real. But 2026 is the year the market gets flooded with vendors who can demo beautifully and deploy terribly.

Your job as CIO isn't to buy AI. It's to buy outcomes. Find the vendor who'll guarantee them.
