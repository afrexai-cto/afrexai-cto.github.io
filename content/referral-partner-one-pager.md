# AfrexAI Referral Partner Program

## You advise. We build. Your clients win.

### The Problem Your Clients Have

Your clients know they need AI automation but they don't have the engineering team to build it. They're stuck between expensive enterprise vendors ($500K+) and risky freelancers who disappear.

What we build: AI agents that automate document review, intake, and compliance checks. Custom workflow automation that reduces 40+ hours per week of manual work. Intelligent data extraction and processing pipelines. Client-facing AI tools like chatbots, portals, and self-service interfaces.
