# LinkedIn Post — Legal AI Implementation Failures

95% of AI pilots fail.

In legal, it's worse. Because law firms keep making the same 3 mistakes:

**1. Starting with the wrong use case.**
Everyone wants the sexy "AI lawyer" demo. But the money is in contract review, due diligence, and doc management. Boring? Sure. But a 200-attorney firm spending 40% of associate time on doc review? That's $8M+ in recoverable capacity.

**2. Buying a platform instead of a solution.**
Your partners don't want to learn another tool. They want the work done. The firms getting ROI from AI aren't rolling out software — they're deploying agents that plug into existing workflows. No training. No change management drama.

**3. Running a "pilot" with no success criteria.**
If your AI pilot doesn't have a dollar amount and a deadline attached to it, it's not a pilot. It's a science project. Define the KPI before you start. Measure it weekly. Kill it or scale it at 90 days.

The 5% that succeed? They pick one high-volume, low-complexity workflow. Deploy something that works in weeks, not months. And measure results in dollars, not "satisfaction scores."

We deploy managed AI agents for law firms. Not software. Not chatbots. Agents that do actual work.

If your firm is spending $2M+ on contract review and due diligence, let's talk.
