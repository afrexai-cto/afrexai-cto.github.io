Every week, another health system announces a new CIO.

And every new CIO walks into the same mess:

→ Legacy systems held together with duct tape
→ A board that read one McKinsey report and now wants "AI everywhere"
→ Staff who've been burned by the last 3 "digital transformation" initiatives
→ Oh, and an HHS AI governance mandate due April 3rd

The playbook most new CIOs follow:
Month 1: Listen and learn
Month 2: Assess the landscape
Month 3: Build a strategy deck

The problem? By month 3, you've already missed the HHS deadline.

Here's what the smartest new CIOs are doing differently:

Week 1: Deploy ONE working AI agent on a contained use case (clinical documentation or claims processing)
Week 2: Measure the output — hours saved, error rates, staff feedback
Week 3: Use those numbers to build your AI governance framework (HHS-ready)
Week 4: Present the board a strategy backed by real results, not slides

The difference between "AI strategy" and "AI results" is about 90 days and one decision.

If you're a new CIO staring at this exact problem — we built the shortcut.
