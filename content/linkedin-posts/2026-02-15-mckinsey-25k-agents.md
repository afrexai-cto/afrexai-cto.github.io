McKinsey just deployed 25,000 AI agents in under two years.

But here's what EY's global engineering chief said: "Some of the best value comes from just a handful of agents doing the heavy lifting."

PwC's chief AI officer agreed — it's not about how many agents you have. It's about how good they are at their jobs.

This is exactly what we see with our clients.

Most companies don't need 25,000 agents. They need 3-5 that actually work.

The difference between an AI pilot that dies in 90 days and one that generates $40K+ in savings? Implementation.

95% of AI pilots fail (MIT). Not because the tech is bad — because nobody managed the agents properly.

That's the gap we fill at AfrexAI. Not selling platforms. Not building chatbots. Managing AI agents that do real work, end-to-end.

Quality over quantity. Every time.
