# LinkedIn Post: Colorado SB 24-205 Compliance Deadline

Colorado's AI Act (SB 24-205) goes live June 30.

If your company uses AI in lending, insurance, or hiring decisions — and you haven't started preparing — you're already behind.

Here's what most fintechs are getting wrong:

**1. Treating it as a legal problem, not a technical one.**
The law requires you to document how your AI makes "consequential decisions." That means impact assessments, bias audits, and explainability. Your legal team can't do this alone. You need engineers in the room.

**2. Assuming "we don't use AI" will hold up.**
If you use ML models for credit scoring, fraud detection, or pricing — congrats, you're in scope. The definition is broader than most companies realize.

**3. Waiting for "final guidance."**
The AG's rulemaking is done. The enforcement date is set. There is no more clarity coming. The companies that move now have a 4-month head start on documentation, testing, and remediation.

We've been helping financial services firms build AI compliance infrastructure — automated bias audits, decision documentation agents, risk assessment frameworks — for organizations that want to lead, not scramble.

June 30 is 4.5 months away. That sounds like a lot until you realize enterprise procurement alone takes 6 weeks.

DM me if you want to talk about what "ready" actually looks like.
