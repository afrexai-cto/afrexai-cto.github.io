# LinkedIn Post — WorkFusion/UiPath Acquisition Angle

UiPath just acquired WorkFusion.

If your bank runs WorkFusion for AML compliance, here's the uncomfortable question nobody's asking:

What happens to your compliance automation when two product roadmaps collide?

We've seen this play out before. Vendor gets acquired → "nothing changes" → 18 months later your platform is sunsetted → you're scrambling.

The banks that win right now are the ones quietly building vendor-independent AI agent architectures. Not locked into one platform. Not dependent on one roadmap.

Three things to think about:

1. Your AML screening doesn't stop because your vendor got acquired. You need continuity NOW, not after a 12-month migration.

2. AI agents can replicate 80% of what WorkFusion does — sanctions screening, adverse media, KYC — without the platform lock-in.

3. The compliance clock doesn't pause. FinCEN doesn't care about your vendor's M&A timeline.

If you're a compliance leader at a bank running WorkFusion, we should talk. Not a sales pitch — just an honest conversation about what your options look like.
