## Why AfrexAI Wins

### 🏎️ Speed: "Week I Win" Guarantee
We deploy a working AI agent demo in your environment within 7 days. Not a PowerPoint. Not a proof of concept roadmap. A working system processing your actual data.

*Big 4 are still scheduling the kickoff meeting.*

### 💰 Economics: 70% Less Than Big 4
No army of junior consultants billing $400/hr to "learn your business." Our team is small, senior, and AI-native. You pay for results, not headcount.

*Typical engagement: $140K-$360K vs. $500K-$2M at Accenture/Deloitte.*

### 🔒 Zero Overrun Guarantee
Fixed-price engagements. If we go over, that's on us. When's the last time a Big 4 firm said that?

### 📈 Managed, Not Abandoned
Post-deployment, we manage your AI agents like a workforce. Monitoring, optimization, retraining. Your AI gets better every month.

*Big 4 hand you a deliverable and disappear. We stay.*

## Who We're For

✅ Mid-market firms ($50M-$5B revenue) tired of overpaying Big 4
✅ Companies who tried AI and it "didn't work" (it wasn't you — it was the implementation)
✅ Leaders who want results this quarter, not next year

## Who We're NOT For

❌ Enterprises who want 200-page strategy decks before doing anything
❌ Companies not ready to change workflows
❌ Anyone looking for the cheapest option (we're the best value, not the cheapest)
