## Twitter / X Snippets

### 1. The Big Number
> $1.6M in projected annual savings from AI-powered contract review. Not by replacing lawyers — by letting them stop doing paralegal work. This is what an AI agent workforce looks like. @AfrexAI

### 2. Construction Reality Check
> A construction PM spends 6+ hours a day on paperwork. AI agents cut that to 45 minutes. $52K saved on a single project. The industry that builds everything is still buried in paper. Time to change that.

### 3. Healthcare Admin Crisis
> 23 minutes of admin per patient visit. Almost as long as the consultation itself. AI agents reduced that by 60%. Imagine what healthcare looks like when clinicians actually have time for patients.

### 4. The Throughput Multiplier
> Same team. Same headcount. 3x the candidate throughput. AI agents handled the screening and scheduling — recruiters handled the relationships. Revenue up $890K.

### 5. Compliance Automation
> 5 days to prepare for an FCA audit → 4 hours. 99.7% suitability check accuracy. AI agents don't get tired, don't miss deadlines, and don't forget to file. Compliance shouldn't be a bottleneck.

### 6. The Workforce Shift (Thought Leadership)
> **The companies winning in 2026 aren't hiring more people. They're deploying AI agent workforces.**
>
> We modeled the impact across 5 industries — legal, construction, healthcare, recruitment, financial services. The results:
>
> 📊 $3.1M+ in combined projected savings
> ⚡ 60–85% efficiency gains
> 🕐 4–10 weeks to deploy
>
> The pattern is the same everywhere: humans doing work that machines should handle, while the work that actually needs human judgment goes undone.
>
> AI agents don't replace your team. They give your team back.

### 7. Legal Ops Deep Dive
> **$1.6M. That's what a multinational compliance firm projected in annual savings from 3 AI agents.**
>
> Contract review: 85% faster. Turnaround: 12 days → 2. Accuracy: 97.3%.
>
> The agents didn't replace a single lawyer. They replaced the 60% of billable hours spent on repetitive extraction and cross-referencing.
>
> Senior lawyers went back to doing senior lawyer work. That's the point.

### 8. The Healthcare Paradox
> **The biggest threat to healthcare isn't a lack of doctors. It's admin.**
>
> A 4-location clinic group was spending 23 minutes of admin per patient visit. Staff turnover was 35%. Patients waited 4+ minutes on hold.
>
> AI agents for scheduling, insurance verification, and documentation cut the admin burden by 60%. Hold times dropped to 15 seconds. 8 staff members were redeployed to patient-facing roles.
>
> Technology should serve care, not compete with it.

### 9. Recruitment Speed Wins
> **In recruitment, speed is revenue.**
>
> A 25-consultant agency was losing £60K/month to slower competitors. Not because their recruiters were worse — because their process was manual.
>
> 3 AI agents. CV screening. Candidate outreach. Interview scheduling.
>
> Result: 3x throughput, time-to-fill cut from 41 to 14 days, $890K in recovered revenue.
>
> The best recruiters aren't the fastest screeners. They're the best closers. AI handles the rest.

### 10. The ROI Question
> **"What's the ROI on AI agents?"**
>
> Here's what we found across 5 modeled deployments:
>
> • Legal: $1.6M saved, 85% faster contract review
> • Construction: $52K saved per project, zero missed inspections
> • Healthcare: 60% admin reduction, 8 staff redeployed to care
> • Recruitment: 3x throughput, $890K recovered revenue
> • Financial: 1,200 hours reclaimed, 99.7% compliance accuracy
>
> Average deployment time: 6 weeks.
> Average payback period: under 90 days.
>
> The question isn't whether you can afford AI agents. It's whether you can afford not to have them.
