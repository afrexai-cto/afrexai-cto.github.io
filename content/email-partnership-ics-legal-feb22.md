Jamie / Anthony,

Came across your AI Practice Group while researching legal tech implementation. Looks like you're doing solid work helping mid-size firms get AI tools running.

We keep running into the same problem from the other side. We build managed AI workforces — autonomous agents handling compliance workflows, document review pipelines, governance frameworks. The firms we talk to already have tools. What they don't have is someone who can get those tools working together and keep them running.

Seems like there might be overlap worth exploring. You bring the law firm relationships and tool expertise, we bring the managed agent infrastructure and governance layer. The result for your clients: they get a complete solution instead of a pile of subscriptions.

No pitch deck, no long call. Just curious if this is something you'd want to explore over a 15-minute chat.

Our CEO Christina Beckford can walk through a couple examples: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Either way — good to see someone actually doing implementation work instead of selling another chatbot.

Kalin Smolichki
CTO, AfrexAI
