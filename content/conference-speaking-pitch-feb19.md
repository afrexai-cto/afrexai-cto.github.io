## Speaking Pitch Template

**Talk Title:** "AI Agents in Production: What We Learned Deploying Autonomous Systems in Regulated Industries"

**Abstract:**
95% of AI pilots fail. The gap isn't technology — it's implementation. This session shares hard-won lessons from deploying AI agent workforces in financial services, legal, and healthcare environments where failure isn't an option.

You'll learn:
- Why chatbots fail but agent systems succeed in regulated environments
- The 3-week implementation framework that cuts deployment time by 80%
- Real compliance wins: $60K/quarter savings, 90% faster document review
- How to sell AI internally when your compliance team says "no"
