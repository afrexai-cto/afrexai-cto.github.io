Subject: Your Legalweek talk + something we built for firms like Dorsey

Hi Caroline,

Caught your session at Legalweek — the bit about balancing innovation speed with partner adoption really resonated.

We build managed AI agents for law firms. Not chatbots. Actual working systems that handle contract review, due diligence triage, and document extraction — with humans in the loop where it matters.

One of our clients cut contract review time by 73% in the first 90 days. No six-month "pilot." Working system, week one.

Dorsey's in an interesting spot — $513M revenue, slipped from the Am Law 100, and from what I can tell, you're the person pushing the firm to use tech as the edge to climb back.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense? I can show you exactly what the contract review agent does — live, on your documents if you want.

Best,
Christina Beckford
