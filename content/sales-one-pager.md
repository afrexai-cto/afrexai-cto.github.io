# AfrexAI: AI Agents That Actually Work

## The Problem

95% of AI pilots fail. Your team spent months on a chatbot that nobody uses. Meanwhile, competitors are automating workflows and cutting costs by 40%.

## What We Do

We build, deploy, and manage AI agent workforces. Not chatbots, not copilots. Autonomous agents that do real work: process documents, handle compliance screening, triage claims, draft contracts.

You get results. We handle the AI.

## How It Works

1. Week 1: We audit your highest-cost manual process and build a working demo
2. Month 1: Production agent deployed, handling real work alongside your team
3. Month 3: Expanded to 3 to 5 workflows. You've already saved $40K+.

## Results (Not Promises)

We secured $111K upfront from our first enterprise client before delivery. Google Cloud reports $3.70 return on every $1 invested in AI agents. Industry benchmarks show 60% cost reduction in document processing. Our sales cycle runs 2 to 4 months vs 12+ months for traditional consulting.

## Who We Work With

Financial Services: KYC/AML screening, compliance reporting. Typical savings $200K to $500K per year.
Legal: Contract review, due diligence, billing. Typical savings $150K to $400K per year.
Healthcare: Clinical documentation, claims processing. Typical savings $180K to $450K per year.

## Pricing

No 18-month contracts. No $2M upfront.

Accelerate: $140K per year. 2 to 3 agents, one department.
Transform: $360K per year. 5 to 8 agents across workflows.
Strategic: $800K per year. Full AI workforce, dedicated team.

All tiers include managed deployment, monitoring, updates, and a dedicated AI engineer.

## Why AfrexAI (Not Accenture)

We ship in days, not quarters. "Week I Win" means a working demo in 7 days. Fixed price with a zero overrun guarantee. If we go over, we eat the cost. We're builders, not slide-makers. Our team writes production code, not PowerPoints. $40K Recovery Guarantee: measurable savings in 90 days or you walk.
