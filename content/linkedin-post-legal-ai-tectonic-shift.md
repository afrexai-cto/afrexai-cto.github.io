Thomson Reuters just dropped their 2026 State of the US Legal Market report.

The headline? "Tectonic shift."

Law firms that reimagine their operating model will win. The rest will get left behind.

But here's what most firms miss: buying an AI tool isn't the same as transforming your operations.

We've seen this pattern over and over:
→ Firm buys Harvey / CoCounsel / generic AI tool
→ 3 partners use it. Everyone else ignores it.
→ 6 months later, leadership asks "where's the ROI?"

The problem isn't the technology. It's the implementation.

Real AI transformation means:
• Mapping every workflow that touches documents, deadlines, or decisions
• Building custom automations that match how YOUR attorneys actually work
• Training staff on the specific use cases that save THEIR time
• Measuring hours saved, not "AI queries made"

The firms acting now aren't just "adopting AI." They're rebuilding how work gets done — and charging clients less while making more.

That's the opportunity. And the window is closing fast.
