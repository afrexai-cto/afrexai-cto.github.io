# Discovery Call Playbook — AfrexAI Managed AI Agents
*For Christina Beckford (CEO) | Updated: Feb 22, 2026*

---

## Pre-Call (2 min)
- Pull prospect from CRM — industry, size, known pain points
- Have ready: ROI one-pager, VADIS case study, relevant vertical one-pager
- Know their competitors who are adopting AI (from our research)

## Opening (2 min)
"Thanks for taking the time. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this focused. We help [industry] companies deploy AI agents that actually work in production — with the governance and compliance controls built in. I'd love to understand what you're dealing with before I show you anything."

## Discovery Questions (10 min)

### Pain
- "What manual processes eat the most time for your team right now?"
- "Have you tried any AI tools? What happened?" *(most will say: piloted something, didn't scale)*
- "What would change if those processes ran 24/7 without errors?"

### Budget & Timeline
- "Do you have budget allocated for AI/automation this year?"
- "Is there a deadline driving this — regulatory, competitive, board mandate?"
- "Who else would need to sign off?"

### Compliance (for regulated industries)
- "How are you handling AI governance today?"
- "Are you aware of [HHS April 3 / EU AI Act August / NIST standards]?"
- "What would an audit of your AI systems look like right now?"

## Demo / Value Prop (5 min)
Don't show tech. Show outcomes.

- "Here's what a typical deployment looks like for a [industry] company your size..."
- Reference VADIS: "We delivered $111K in value pre-delivery for a similar client"
- Reference ROI: "For a 200-person company, we typically see 353% ROI in year one, payback in under 3 months"
- Show the 3 tiers: Single Agent ($1,500/mo), Department ($3,500/mo), Full Swarm ($5,000/mo)

## Objection Handling

### "Too expensive"
"I get it. Let's look at it differently — what does one compliance violation cost? One missed deadline? One manual error that takes 40 hours to fix? Our clients typically save 3-4x what they pay us. And we start at $750 for the first month so you can prove it before committing."

### "We'll build it ourselves"
"Some companies do. It usually takes 6-12 months and a dedicated team. We deploy in 7 days. The question is: can you afford to wait 6 months while your competitors are deploying now?"

### "How do we know it works?"
"We delivered $111K in value before the client even paid. We offer a 7-day 'Week I Win' — if we don't show measurable impact in the first week, you walk. No risk."

### "We're not ready for AI"
"That's actually our sweet spot. 95% of AI projects fail because of implementation, not technology. We handle everything — setup, governance, monitoring, optimization. Your team doesn't need AI expertise. That's what you're hiring us for."

### "Need to think about it"
"Totally fair. What specific concerns would you want resolved? I can send you [case study / ROI analysis / compliance checklist] to share with your team. Can we schedule a 15-minute follow-up for [specific date]?"

## Close (3 min)
- "Based on what you've shared, here's what I'd recommend as a starting point..."
- Always propose the intro offer: $750 first month
- Always set next step: "Can we get a kickoff on the calendar for [date]?"
- If not ready: "I'll send the ROI breakdown and case study. Let's reconnect [specific day]."

## Post-Call (5 min)
- Update CRM stage immediately
- Send follow-up email within 2 hours: summary of discussion + next steps + relevant attachments
- If qualified: schedule internal debrief with Kalin
- Log in daily brief

| Department | $3,500 | $1,750 | 3-5 agents, one department |
| Full Swarm | $5,000 | $2,500 | Enterprise-wide, 8+ agents |

## Key Stats to Drop
- 353% ROI, 2.6-month payback (200-person company)
- $111K delivered pre-payment (VADIS)
- 7-day deployment ("Week I Win")
- 95% of AI projects fail — we're the 5%
- 86-96% gross margins (don't say this to prospects obviously)

## Competitor Positioning
- **vs. Accenture/Deloitte**: "They charge $500K+ and take 6 months. We deploy in 7 days for $1,500/mo."
- **vs. SaaS tools (interface.ai, etc.)**: "They sell software you still need to implement. We sell outcomes."
- **vs. internal build**: "6-12 months and a dedicated team vs. 7 days and zero hiring."
