### HOOK (0:00–0:15)

**[VISUAL: Christina direct to camera, casual but authoritative]**

**CHRISTINA:** "The number one question I get from executives is: 'How long does this actually take?' So today I'm pulling back the curtain. Here's exactly what happens in the first 90 days when you deploy an AI agent workforce with AfrexAI."

### SECTION 1: Before Day One (0:15–0:50)

**[VISUAL: Christina at a table, timeline graphic on screen]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Before the clock even starts, we do a discovery call. That's the call you can book right now — link in the description. In 30 minutes, we figure out whether AI agents are the right fit for your business. Not everything should be automated, and we'll tell you that honestly."

**[VISUAL: Checklist graphic — "Discovery Call → Fit Assessment → Proposal"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "If there's a fit, we put together a proposal with projected ROI, scope, and timeline. You approve it — and Day One begins."

---

### SECTION 2: Days 1–30 — Audit & Design (0:50–1:50)

**[VISUAL: "PHASE 1: AUDIT & DESIGN" title card, then Christina at whiteboard]**

**CHRISTINA:** "The first 30 days are about understanding your operation better than you do. Our team embeds with yours. We map every workflow, every handoff, every decision point."

**CHRISTINA:** "We're looking for three things: where are the bottlenecks, where are the errors, and where is human judgment genuinely required versus where is it just habit?"

**[VISUAL: B-roll — team workshops, sticky notes on glass walls, screen shares]**

**CHRISTINA:** "By the end of Phase 1, you get a full automation blueprint. It shows you which agents we'll build, what they'll do, how they'll integrate with your existing systems, and what the expected impact is. No surprises."

### SECTION 3: Days 31–60 — Build & Test (1:50–2:50)

**[VISUAL: "PHASE 2: BUILD & TEST" title card]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Phase 2 is where we build. Our engineering team constructs your AI agents — custom-trained on your data, your processes, your compliance requirements."

**[VISUAL: Code/dashboard montage — agent configuration, testing screens, data flows]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Each agent goes through rigorous testing. We run them against historical data — real cases, real documents, real transactions from your business. We compare agent outputs to human outputs. We measure accuracy, speed, and edge-case handling."

**[VISUAL: Split-screen — "Agent output" vs "Human output" with accuracy metrics]**

**CHRISTINA:** "You're involved the whole time. Your team reviews outputs, flags issues, and validates that agents are meeting your standards. We don't go live until everyone's confident."

### SECTION 4: Days 61–90 — Deploy & Optimise (2:50–3:30)

**[VISUAL: "PHASE 3: DEPLOY & OPTIMISE" title card]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Phase 3 — we go live. But not all at once. We deploy agents in stages, starting with the highest-impact, lowest-risk workflows."

**[VISUAL: Staged rollout diagram — Wave 1, Wave 2, Wave 3]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Your team works alongside the agents for the first two weeks. Think of it like onboarding a new employee — except this employee learns from corrections in real time."

**CHRISTINA:** "By Day 90, your AI agent workforce is fully operational. But we don't disappear. AfrexAI continues to manage, monitor, and optimise your agents on an ongoing basis. That's what 'managed' means."

---

### SECTION 5: What You DON'T Need to Worry About (3:30–3:45)

**[VISUAL: Rapid-fire list with checkmarks]**

**CHRISTINA:** "You don't need an AI team. You don't need to change your tech stack. You don't need a six-month IT project. We handle the technology. You focus on your business."

---

### CTA & CLOSE (3:45–4:00)

**[VISUAL: Christina standing, direct to camera]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Ready to see what 90 days could do for your business? The first step is a 30-minute call. No commitment, no sales pitch — just an honest conversation about where AI agents fit."

**[VISUAL: End card — booking link, QR code, 90-day timeline graphic]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Link's in the description. I'm Christina Beckford — let's build your workforce."
