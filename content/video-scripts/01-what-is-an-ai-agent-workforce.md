### HOOK (0:00–0:15)

**[VISUAL: Christina walking through a modern office, camera tracking alongside her]**

**CHRISTINA:** "What if I told you there's a workforce that never sleeps, never calls in sick, and costs a fraction of a traditional employee — but can do the work of an entire department?"

**[VISUAL: Quick-cut montage — AI dashboards, automated workflows, data streams]**

**CHRISTINA:** "I'm not talking about chatbots. I'm talking about something fundamentally different. This is an AI agent workforce."

### SECTION 1: The Problem (0:15–1:00)

**[VISUAL: Christina at desk, B-roll of overwhelmed office workers, overflowing inboxes, spreadsheets]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Right now, your business runs on people doing repetitive, rules-based work. Processing invoices. Reviewing contracts. Answering the same customer questions over and over. Scheduling. Data entry. Compliance checks."

**[VISUAL: On-screen text — "60-70% of knowledge work is repetitive"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Studies show that up to 70% of knowledge work is repetitive. That's not a people problem — it's a systems problem. Your talented team is buried in busywork instead of doing what actually moves the needle."

### SECTION 2: What an AI Agent Actually Is (1:00–2:00)

**[VISUAL: Animated explainer — single AI agent icon performing a task end-to-end]**

**CHRISTINA:** "So what IS an AI agent? An AI agent is an autonomous digital worker. Not a tool you click buttons on. Not a chatbot that answers FAQs. An agent that receives a task, makes decisions, takes actions, and delivers results — just like a human employee would."

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side animation — "Tool" (waits for input) vs "Agent" (acts independently)]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Think of it this way: a tool waits for you to use it. An agent goes and does the work."

**CHRISTINA:** "Now, an AI agent WORKFORCE is a team of these agents — each specialised for a different function. You might have an agent handling client intake, another managing document review, another running financial reconciliation, another monitoring compliance. They work together, hand off tasks to each other, and escalate to humans only when they need to."

### SECTION 3: What Makes It "Managed" (2:00–3:00)

**[VISUAL: Christina standing, gesturing to screen showing AfrexAI dashboard mockup]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Here's where AfrexAI comes in. We don't just sell you software and wish you luck. We build, deploy, and MANAGE your AI agent workforce for you."

**[VISUAL: Three-step graphic — "Design → Deploy → Manage"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Step one — we audit your operations and identify where agents will have the biggest impact. Step two — we build and deploy custom agents trained on YOUR processes, YOUR data, YOUR compliance requirements. Step three — we manage them ongoing. We monitor performance, optimise workflows, handle updates, and scale agents up or down as your business needs change."

**[VISUAL: B-roll of team monitoring dashboards, analytics screens]**

**CHRISTINA:** "You get the output of a larger workforce without the overhead of hiring, training, or managing it. We handle all of that."

### SECTION 4: Who This Is For (3:00–3:30)

**[VISUAL: Icons/footage representing each sector as Christina names them]**

**CHRISTINA:** "This isn't theoretical. We're deploying AI agent workforces right now in law firms, financial services, healthcare administration, logistics companies, and professional services. If your business runs on process-heavy knowledge work, this was built for you."

### CTA & CLOSE (3:30–4:00)

**[VISUAL: Christina direct to camera, warm and confident]**

**CHRISTINA:** "If you're spending hundreds of thousands — or millions — on tasks that don't require human creativity or judgment, let's talk. We'll show you exactly where AI agents fit in your operation and what the numbers look like."
