### HOOK (0:00–0:20)

**[VISUAL: Black screen, numbers ticking up like a stock ticker — then freeze]**

**CHRISTINA (V.O.):** "Everyone talks about AI ROI. Almost nobody shows you the actual maths."

**[VISUAL: Cut to Christina, direct to camera]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Today I'm going to show you real numbers — what AI agents cost, what they save, and how fast you get your money back. No hype. No hand-waving. Just the economics."

### SECTION 1: The Cost of Doing Nothing (0:20–1:15)

**[VISUAL: Christina at desk with on-screen graphics building as she speaks]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Let's start with what you're spending right now. Take a mid-size professional services firm — 200 employees. Across admin, operations, and back office, you've probably got 40 to 60 people doing primarily process-driven work."

**[VISUAL: On-screen calculation building]**
- **60 process staff × £45,000 avg salary = £2.7M/year**
- **+ office space, equipment, benefits = ~£3.5M total cost**

**CHRISTINA:** "Three and a half million a year on work that is largely repetitive, rules-based, and predictable. I'm not saying those people aren't valuable — I'm saying the WORK they're doing doesn't require human intelligence."

**[VISUAL: Pie chart — "Human judgment required: ~20%" vs "Automatable: ~80%"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "In our experience, roughly 80 percent of that process work can be handled by AI agents. The remaining 20 percent genuinely needs a human — exceptions, judgment calls, complex decisions. That's where your people should be focused."

### SECTION 2: What AI Agents Actually Cost (1:15–2:10)

**[VISUAL: Clean pricing breakdown graphic]**

**CHRISTINA:** "So what does an AI agent workforce cost? I'll give you real ranges."

**[VISUAL: Three-tier graphic appearing]**

- **"Implementation (one-time): £75K–£200K depending on complexity"**
- **"Managed service (annual): £120K–£350K depending on agent count and scope"**
- **"Total Year 1: £200K–£550K"**

**CHRISTINA:** "Let's take the high end. Half a million pounds in Year 1 for a full AI agent workforce — designed, deployed, and managed."

**[VISUAL: Comparison bar chart]**
- **Current cost: £3.5M/year**
- **AI agent workforce: £550K Year 1, £350K/year ongoing**
- **Savings Year 1: £2.1M+ (after accounting for redeployment costs)**

**CHRISTINA:** "Even in Year 1, with implementation costs, you're looking at savings north of two million pounds. From Year 2 onwards, you're saving over three million annually. The payback period is typically three to five months."

**[VISUAL: Bold graphic — "Payback period: 3–5 months"]**

### SECTION 3: Beyond Cost Savings (2:10–3:10)

**[VISUAL: Christina standing, more animated]**

**CHRISTINA:** "But ROI isn't just about cutting costs. Let me give you the numbers people forget."

**[VISUAL: Each metric appearing with an icon]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Speed. Our agents process documents 12 times faster than humans on average. That means clients get served faster, deals close sooner, and revenue comes in quicker."

- **[GRAPHIC: "12× faster document processing"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Accuracy. Agents don't have bad days. We consistently see error rates drop by 90 percent or more."

- **[GRAPHIC: "90%+ reduction in processing errors"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Scalability. When your business grows 30 percent, you don't need to hire 30 percent more staff. You scale the agent workforce — which takes days, not months."

- **[GRAPHIC: "Scale in days, not months"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "And capacity. AI agents work 24/7. That's three shifts for the price of a fraction of one. If you serve international clients across time zones, that alone is a game-changer."

- **[GRAPHIC: "24/7 capacity — 3× output vs single shift"]**

### SECTION 4: The Real-World Proof (3:10–3:50)

**[VISUAL: Case study snapshots — logos anonymised or with permission]**

**CHRISTINA:** "These aren't projections. Across our deployments:"

**[VISUAL: Results appearing]**

- **"Law firm: £1.6M saved, 87% faster processing"**
- **"Financial services: 94% of compliance checks automated"**
- **"Healthcare admin: Patient onboarding cut from 4 days to 4 hours"**
- **"Logistics: Invoice reconciliation from 3 days to 20 minutes"**

**CHRISTINA:** "Every single deployment has paid for itself within the first year. Most within the first two quarters."

### SECTION 5: How to Calculate Your ROI (3:50–4:15)

**[VISUAL: Simple formula on screen]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Here's a quick way to estimate your potential savings. Take the number of people doing process work. Multiply by their fully loaded cost. Multiply by 0.7 — that's a conservative estimate of what agents can handle. That's your annual saving potential."

**[VISUAL: Formula — "Process staff × Loaded cost × 0.7 = Annual saving potential"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Then subtract the cost of the agent workforce. If the number makes you sit up in your chair — we should talk."
