### HOOK (0:00–0:20)

**[VISUAL: Black screen, white text fading in — "$1,600,000"]**

**CHRISTINA (V.O.):** "One point six million dollars. That's how much a mid-size law firm was spending every year on work that didn't require a single law degree."

**[VISUAL: Cut to Christina, direct to camera, seated in a professional setting]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Today I'm going to walk you through exactly how we eliminated that cost — without firing a single person — using an AI agent workforce. This is the VADIS case study."

### SECTION 1: The Client (0:20–1:10)

**[VISUAL: B-roll of law office — files, conference rooms, paralegals working. All generic/stock.]**

**CHRISTINA:** "VADIS is a specialist law firm. Like most firms their size, they'd grown fast — but their back office hadn't kept up. They had skilled solicitors spending hours on document intake, compliance checks, client onboarding forms, and contract review for standard clauses."

**[VISUAL: On-screen stat — "Solicitors spent 35% of billable time on admin"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Their solicitors were spending roughly 35 percent of their time on administrative work. That's not just an efficiency problem — that's lost revenue. Every hour a solicitor spends on admin is an hour they're not billing a client."

**[VISUAL: Simple calculator animation — "35% × billable hours × hourly rate = massive cost"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "And behind them, they had a team of paralegals and admin staff manually processing documents, chasing signatures, checking compliance boxes. Good people, doing work that machines should be doing."

### SECTION 2: The Diagnosis (1:10–2:00)

**[VISUAL: Christina at whiteboard or screen, sketching the workflow]**

**CHRISTINA:** "When we came in, the first thing we did was a full operational audit. We mapped every process, every handoff, every bottleneck. And we found five major areas where AI agents could take over immediately."

**[VISUAL: Animated list appearing one by one]**

**CHRISTINA:**
- "One — client intake and onboarding. Forms, ID verification, conflict checks."
- "Two — document review for standard contract clauses. Not complex litigation — routine review."
- "Three — compliance monitoring and regulatory checks."
- "Four — billing and time entry reconciliation."
- "Five — internal knowledge retrieval — finding precedents, templates, and prior case notes."

**[VISUAL: Highlight graphic — "5 workflows = 80% of admin burden"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "These five workflows accounted for roughly 80 percent of their administrative burden."

### SECTION 3: The Solution (2:00–3:00)

**[VISUAL: AfrexAI dashboard mockup, agent workflow diagrams]**

**CHRISTINA:** "We deployed a managed AI agent workforce — seven agents in total, each purpose-built for one of these functions. The intake agent handles new client forms end-to-end. The review agent scans contracts against a clause library and flags anomalies. The compliance agent monitors regulatory updates in real time and cross-references active cases."

**[VISUAL: Animated workflow — document flows from intake → review → compliance → billing automatically]**

**CHRISTINA:** "And critically, these agents talk to each other. A new client comes in — the intake agent processes their documents, hands them to the review agent, which flags anything that needs human attention, and routes clean files straight into the case management system. No human touched it unless something was genuinely unusual."

**[VISUAL: Graphic — "Human in the loop — by exception, not by default"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Humans stay in the loop — but by exception, not by default. That's the key shift."

### SECTION 4: The Results (3:00–3:50)

**[VISUAL: Results appearing as bold on-screen graphics, one at a time]**

**CHRISTINA:** "Within six months, here's what happened."

- **[GRAPHIC: "87% reduction in document processing time"]**
- **[GRAPHIC: "£1.6M annual cost saving"]**
- **[GRAPHIC: "Solicitor admin time: 35% → 8%"]**
- **[GRAPHIC: "Zero increase in error rates"]**
- **[GRAPHIC: "Client onboarding: 5 days → same day"]**

**CHRISTINA:** "One point six million in savings. Solicitors got 27 percent of their time back to do actual legal work — which means more billable hours, more revenue. Client onboarding went from five days to same-day. And error rates didn't go up — they went down, because agents don't get tired at 4pm on a Friday."

### SECTION 5: What Happened to the Staff (3:50–4:10)

**[VISUAL: Christina, sincere tone, direct to camera]**

**CHRISTINA:** "And the team? Nobody was made redundant. The admin staff were redeployed into higher-value client-facing roles. The paralegals moved into case support work they'd been wanting to do for years. That's what this technology should do — free people up, not push them out."

### CTA & CLOSE (4:10–4:30)
