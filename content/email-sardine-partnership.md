# Sardine Partnership Outreach — For Christina to Send
*Draft: 2026-02-14 | Target: Soups Ranjan, CEO*

## LinkedIn Connection Request (first touch)
"Hi Soups — I lead AfrexAI, an AI implementation consultancy focused on compliance automation for financial services. Your work at Sardine on fraud/AML tooling is impressive. We're seeing a gap where companies buy great software like yours but struggle with implementation and operationalization. Would love to explore a software + services partnership. — Christina"

**Subject:** Sardine + AfrexAI: Helping your clients actually use what they buy

Hi Soups,

Christina Beckford here, CEO at AfrexAI.

Quick context: we build and manage AI agent workforces for financial services firms — compliance, KYC/AML screening, document review. Our clients typically see 60-80% reduction in manual review time within 90 days.

I've been watching Sardine's growth — 250+ businesses across 150 countries is no joke. And I keep hearing the same thing from compliance teams at companies your size serves: they buy the tools, but getting them embedded into workflows is where it falls apart.

That's exactly what we do. We don't compete with Sardine — we make Sardine stickier.

**The pitch:** A referral partnership where you point clients who need hands-on implementation to us. We manage the AI agent layer that sits on top of your platform. You get happier clients with lower churn. We get warm intros.

Simple rev-share: 15% for 12 months on any referred client.

Worth a 20-minute call to explore? I'm flexible on timing.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
