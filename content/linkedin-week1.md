# LinkedIn Week 1 — Kalin Smolichki (CTO, AfrexAI)

## Monday — "I run 9 AI agents for my startup 24/7"

I run 9 AI agents for my startup. 24/7. No breaks. No salaries.

Let me explain.

There's an agent that finds leads. Another one that writes cold emails. One that builds landing pages. One that monitors our competitors. One that writes content. One that handles research. One that manages our CRM. One that does financial analysis. One that codes.

Nine agents. Two humans.

My co-founder and I started AfrexAI with a simple bet: what if we never hired for tasks an AI agent could do instead?

Not chatbots. Not "ask me anything" widgets. Actual autonomous agents that wake up, check their queue, do the work, and report back.

Some of them run on schedules. Some trigger off events. Some talk to each other.

The result?

We operate like a 15-person company. Our burn rate says otherwise.

Last month our agents sent 3,000+ cold emails, built 15 web pages, wrote 40+ pieces of content, and sourced 200+ leads. While we slept.

This isn't theory. This is our daily reality.

And here's the thing — we're not special. The tools exist. The models exist. Most companies just haven't wired them together yet.

That's what we do at AfrexAI. We build these systems for other companies too.

More on that this week. Follow along if you want the unfiltered version of building a company with AI agents.

## Tuesday — "We sent 100 cold emails yesterday. Here's what happened."

We sent 100 cold emails yesterday.

Here's what happened.

23 opens in the first hour. 11 replies by end of day. 3 booked calls. 1 is a law firm with 200+ employees.

Not bad for a Tuesday.

But here's what most people miss — I didn't write a single one of those emails.

Our outreach agent did.

It pulls from our lead list (sourced by another agent), personalises each email based on the prospect's website and recent activity, and sends them in batches throughout the day.

I review a sample each morning. Maybe tweak the angle. That's it.

"But Kalin, cold email is dead."

Tell that to the law firm booking a call with us on Thursday.

Cold email isn't dead. Bad cold email is dead.

Generic templates? Dead.
"I hope this finds you well"? Dead.
Mass-blasted garbage? Very dead.

But a well-researched, personalised message that shows you understand someone's problem? That works. Always has.

The difference now is that an AI agent can do the research and personalisation at scale. What used to take a BDR 4 hours takes our agent 20 minutes.

We're not replacing the human touch. We're making it possible to deliver the human touch to 100 people a day instead of 10.

Tomorrow I'll break down why AI agents are NOT chatbots. People keep confusing the two and it's costing them.

## Wednesday — "AI agents are not chatbots. Here's the difference."

AI agents are not chatbots.

I keep hearing people use these words interchangeably and it drives me mad.

Let me clear this up.

A chatbot waits for you to ask it something. Then it responds. Then it waits again. It's reactive. It's a tool. You drive.

An AI agent has a goal, a set of tools, and autonomy. It plans. It acts. It adjusts. It drives itself.

Think of it this way:

A chatbot is a calculator. You punch in numbers, it gives you an answer.

An AI agent is an employee. You give it a brief, it figures out the steps, does the work, and comes back with results.

Our cold email agent doesn't wait for me to say "send emails." It checks the lead queue every morning, researches each prospect, writes personalised outreach, and sends it. I wake up to a report.

Our web builder agent doesn't need me to dictate copy. I give it a brief — "build a landing page for legal firms focused on cost recovery" — and it designs, writes, and deploys it.

That's the shift.

The companies winning with AI right now aren't the ones with the best chatbots. They're the ones deploying agents that do actual work autonomously.

At AfrexAI, we build these agent systems for businesses. Not toys. Not demos. Production systems that run daily.

If you're still thinking about AI as "a smarter search bar," you're already behind.

## Thursday — "A law firm was leaking $1.6M and didn't know it"

A law firm was leaking $1.6M a year.

They had no idea.

Here's the story.

VADIS, a mid-size legal firm, came to us with a familiar problem: "We're busy but margins are thin."

So we ran a diagnostic. Not a vague consulting audit. We deployed AI agents to analyse their operations — time tracking, case allocation, billing patterns, resource utilisation.

What we found was brutal.

£1.6 million in recoverable capacity. Hidden in plain sight.

Where was it going?

Senior lawyers doing admin work that should've been delegated or automated. Cases sitting idle for days because of handoff bottlenecks. Billing leakage — work done but never invoiced. Duplicated research across teams who didn't talk to each other.

None of this was visible in their dashboards. Their reports said everything was fine. The agents dug deeper.

We didn't sell them AI agents.

We showed them exactly where money was disappearing and built systems to stop the bleeding. Some of that involved agents. Some involved simple process changes. Some involved better tooling.

The result? A clear roadmap to recover that £1.6M. Not in theory. In identified, actionable capacity.

This is what I mean when I say we sell recovered capacity, not technology.

Every mid-size firm has a number like this hiding in their operations. Most just haven't looked.

## Friday — "We built 15 web pages in one night with AI agents"

We built 15 web pages in one night.

Not wireframes. Not drafts. Fully designed, written, and deployed pages.

Here's how.

Wednesday night, 9pm. My co-founder and I decided AfrexAI needed industry-specific landing pages. Legal. Finance. Healthcare. Consulting. And more.

Old way? Hire a designer. Brief a copywriter. Wait two weeks. Spend £5K+.

Our way? Brief the agent.

I wrote a one-paragraph brief for each page: target industry, key pain points, desired CTA. Fed them into our web builder agent.

By midnight, it had generated copy for all 15 pages. Not filler. Actual copy that understood each industry's problems, spoke their language, and positioned our offer clearly.

By 2am, the pages were designed and deployed.

I spent Thursday morning reviewing them, tweaking maybe 10% of the copy, and adjusting a few design elements.

Total human time: ~4 hours across two people.
Total cost beyond our existing tools: £0.
Total pages live: 15.

A few months ago, this would've taken us weeks and thousands of pounds. Now it's a late night and some coffee.

This is what I mean when I talk about AI agents as force multipliers. We didn't remove the human. We removed the bottleneck.

The pages are live. Go look.

## Saturday — "Why I don't sell AI agents (and what I sell instead)"

Why I don't sell AI agents.

Sounds weird coming from a guy who runs an AI agent company. Let me explain.

When we talk to potential clients, they usually say some version of: "We want AI agents."

And I always ask: "Why?"

Silence. Or some vague answer about innovation and staying competitive.

Here's the truth: nobody actually wants AI agents. They want what AI agents produce.

They want the 40 hours a week their team wastes on manual data entry back. They want the £500K in billing leakage plugged. They want the 3x more outreach without hiring 3 more BDRs.

They want recovered capacity.

That's what we sell.

When we did the VADIS diagnostic, we didn't walk in and say "here are 7 AI agents, that'll be £80K." We said "you're losing £1.6M annually, here's exactly where, and here's how we fix it."

Some fixes are AI agents. Some are process redesign. Some are better use of tools they already pay for.

The agent is the mechanism. The value is the recovered time, money, and capacity.

This framing changes everything. It changes how we price. How we pitch. How we measure success.

We don't measure "number of agents deployed." We measure pounds recovered, hours saved, revenue unlocked.

If you're buying AI, ask your vendor: what capacity am I recovering?

If they can't answer that, they're selling you technology, not value.

## Sunday — "The $11M plan: how 2 people and 9 AI agents are building a company"

The $11M plan.

Two people. Nine AI agents. One very ambitious spreadsheet.

Here's the vision for AfrexAI — unfiltered.

We're building a company that proves a radical thesis: a tiny team augmented by AI agents can compete with firms 10x their size.

Not in theory. In revenue. In output. In impact.

Our target: $11M in revenue within 36 months.

Here's how the maths works:

We're not selling hours. We're selling recovered capacity. Our diagnostic finds six- and seven-figure inefficiencies in mid-size firms. We take a percentage of the recovery as our fee.

One client recovering £1.6M = a substantial contract for us. Ten clients? You see where this goes.

Our agents handle the work that would normally require a team of 15-20: lead gen, outreach, content, research, web development, financial modelling, CRM management, competitive analysis.

My co-founder handles strategy, sales, and client relationships. I build the agents, the systems, and the tech.

We keep the team small on purpose. Every person we don't hire is margin we keep. Every agent we build is leverage that compounds.

Will it work? I genuinely don't know.

But I know the model is sound. I know the agents deliver. And I know the market is massive — every mid-size firm in the UK is sitting on hidden inefficiency.

This week I've shared how we operate. The agents. The outreach. The results. The philosophy.

If this resonated, follow me. I'll keep building in public.
