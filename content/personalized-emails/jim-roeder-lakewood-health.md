**Subject:** Quick question about AI at Lakewood Health

Hi Jim,

Saw your comments in HealthTech Magazine about where Lakewood is headed with AI — sounds like you're past the "should we?" phase and into "how do we make it stick?"

That's exactly where we work best.

We build managed AI agents for health systems your size — clinical documentation, claims processing, patient scheduling. Not pilots that die after 90 days. Production systems that actually reduce the FTE burden.

One example: a 12-hospital system cut clinical documentation time by 40% and reduced claims denials by 23% in the first quarter. No new hires, no 18-month implementation.

Would it make sense to show you what that looks like for Lakewood? Happy to do a 20-minute walkthrough — no pitch deck, just the actual agent in action.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Notes
- Rural health systems have acute staffing problems — lead with FTE relief
- Lakewood is mid-market = CIO has budget authority, no committee of 12
- Keep it short — rural CIOs are operators, not strategists
- Follow up Day 3 with compliance angle (CMS changes, prior auth automation)
