## Body (<120 words)

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: how many of your 2025 AI pilots actually made it to production?

Industry data says less than 5%. Not because the tech doesn't work — because nobody managed the messy middle between "cool demo" and "runs in production with compliance sign-off."

That's what we do at AfrexAI. We take stalled AI initiatives in financial services — compliance screening, document processing, client reporting — and get them running in production. Managed. Monitored. Compliant.

We just helped a financial services firm cut $636K in annual processing costs with AI agents that passed their compliance review.

Worth a 15-minute call next week?

## Day 5 Follow-up

Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share something relevant — a third of all Chief AI Officer appointments in the last 6 months happened between November and February. The pressure to show AI results is real and accelerating.

If your team is sitting on stalled pilots or facing board-level questions about AI ROI, happy to share how we've helped similar firms move from experiment to production in 4-6 weeks.

No deck. Just a conversation.

## Day 12 Break-up

Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short — if turning AI experiments into production results isn't a priority right now, totally understand.

But if it is, we're currently onboarding two new financial services clients and have capacity for one more this quarter.

Either way, no hard feelings. Just didn't want to assume silence meant "not interested" when it might mean "buried."
