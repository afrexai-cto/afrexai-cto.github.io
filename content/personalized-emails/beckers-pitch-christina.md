**Subject:** Contributed Article Pitch: Why 95% of Healthcare AI Pilots Fail

**Body:**

Hi there,

I run AfrexAI — we deploy managed AI agents for health systems and large physician groups. Prior auth automation, claims scrubbing, clinical documentation, that sort of thing.

I'd love to write a contributed piece for Becker's. Working title:

**"Why 95% of Healthcare AI Pilots Fail — And What the 5% Do Differently"**

The angle: most hospitals treat AI like a software install. Buy a tool, plug it in, hope for the best. That's why pilots die. The 5% that work treat AI like a new hire — they onboard it, manage it, measure it against specific KPIs, and have a human in the loop for the first 90 days.

I'd cover:
- The 3 most common failure modes we see (scope creep, no success metrics, IT-led instead of ops-led)
- What "production-ready" actually means vs. vendor demos
- A 90-day deployment framework that health systems can steal
- Real numbers: claims denial reduction, prior auth turnaround, documentation time savings

No product pitch. Just practical stuff for CIOs and COOs who are tired of AI hype.

Happy to send a draft first or work to whatever editorial guidelines you prefer. ~1,200-1,500 words, whatever fits best.

Thanks for considering it.
