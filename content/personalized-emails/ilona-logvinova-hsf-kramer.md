# Personalized Outreach: Ilona Logvinova, Chief AI Officer — HSF Kramer
*Drafted: 2026-02-14 | Status: DRAFT — needs Christina's review before sending*

## Background
- **Role:** Chief AI Officer, HSF Kramer (formerly Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, merged with Herbert Smith Freehills)
- **Previous:** McKinsey (legal practice), Mastercard
- **Appointed:** November 2025 — building global AI strategy FROM SCRATCH
- **Why she's #1 target:** Brand new in role, needs implementation partners NOW. Ex-McKinsey = understands consulting model. Ex-Mastercard = enterprise-grade expectations. Building from zero = no incumbent to displace.

## Email Draft

**Subject:** Building AI ops from scratch at HSF Kramer — a thought

Hi Ilona,

Saw you stepped into the Chief AI Officer role at HSF Kramer back in November — congrats. Building a global AI strategy from scratch at a firm going through a merger is about as challenging as it gets.

Quick question: are you looking at AI for the practice side (contract review, due diligence, research) or the operations side (intake, billing, knowledge management) first?

We work with law firms on AI agent implementation — not chatbots, but actual autonomous agents that handle specific workflows end-to-end. One firm we worked with cut contract review time by 73% in the first 90 days.

Given you're building from the ground up, thought it might be useful to compare notes. Happy to share what we've seen work (and not work) across Am Law firms making similar moves.

Would a 20-minute call next week be useful?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Notes
- DO NOT mention Kalin or CTO role
- Christina sends from her email
- Follow up in 5 days if no response
- If she replies, fast-track to discovery call — she's ideal for $500K+ Strategic tier
- Personalization hooks: "from scratch", merger complexity, McKinsey background (she values structured approaches)
