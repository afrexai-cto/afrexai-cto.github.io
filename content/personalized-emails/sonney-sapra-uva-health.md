## Email 1 — Warm Intro (Send week of Feb 24)

**Subject:** Quick congrats + a question about AI at UVA Health

**Body:**

Sonney,

Congrats on the CIO role at UVA Health. Saw the announcement — Mitch Rosner's comment about harnessing AI stood out. Most health systems say that. Very few have someone with 15 years of health IT depth to actually make it happen.

Quick question: as you're evaluating your first 90-day priorities, where does clinical documentation automation sit on the list?

We build managed AI agents for health systems — not chatbots, actual working agents that handle claims processing, clinical documentation, and compliance workflows. One deployment typically saves 12,000+ staff hours annually.

With the HHS AI governance mandate hitting April 3rd, most new CIOs are getting blindsided by the compliance timeline. Happy to share how we're helping other systems get ahead of it.

Worth a 15-minute call next week?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — Case Study Follow-up (Send 5 days after Email 1 if no reply)

**Subject:** Re: Quick congrats + a question about AI at UVA Health

**Body:**

Sonney,

Know you're heads-down in your first month — just wanted to share something relevant.

A comparable academic medical center deployed our AI agents for clinical documentation and cut physician admin time by 40%. The compliance piece was the kicker — they were HHS-ready 6 weeks before the deadline.

Given UVA Health's research mission, there's also an angle on automating IRB document processing that most vendors miss entirely.

If the timing isn't right now, no worries. But if AI governance is on your Q1 radar, this is the fastest path I've seen.

## Email 3 — Break-up (Send 7 days after Email 2 if no reply)

**Subject:** closing the loop

**Body:**

Sonney,

Not trying to clog your inbox — I'll close the loop here.

If AI agent deployment or HHS compliance prep becomes a priority this quarter, we're at afrexai.com. We work exclusively with health systems and can usually show a working demo within a week.

Wishing you a strong start at UVA.

Christina
