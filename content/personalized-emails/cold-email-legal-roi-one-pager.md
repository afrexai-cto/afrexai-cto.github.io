## Body (<120 words)

Hi [FirstName],

Quick question — how many contracts does your team review per month?

Most legal teams we talk to are spending 65% of attorney time on routine review that AI agents can handle in 12 minutes instead of 60.

We just helped a mid-market firm cut contract review costs by $636K annually while tripling their throughput. Their attorneys now spend time on strategy and negotiation instead of first-pass redlining.

I put together a one-page breakdown of the numbers. Worth a look?

If this resonates, I'd love 15 minutes to show you how it works on your actual contracts.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Follow-up (Day 7)

Subject: Re: [original subject]

[FirstName] — wanted to make sure this didn't get buried.

The short version: our AI agents do first-pass contract review (clause extraction, risk flagging, redlining) at 80% lower cost than attorney time. Live in 4 weeks, not 6 months.

Happy to send the ROI breakdown if helpful.
