# Cut Your Contract Review Costs by 60% With AI Agents

**For General Counsels & Legal Operations Leaders**

---

## The Problem

Your team reviews **hundreds of contracts per month**. Each one takes 45-90 minutes of attorney time at $300-$500/hour. That's $150K-$450K/year just on routine contract review — before negotiation even starts.

Meanwhile, 72% of legal departments report attorney burnout as their #1 retention challenge.

## What AfrexAI Does

We deploy **managed AI agents** that handle first-pass contract review, clause extraction, risk flagging, and redlining — integrated into your existing workflow (iManage, NetDocs, SharePoint).

Not a chatbot. Not a search tool. A working agent that does the actual work.

## The Numbers

| Metric | Before AI Agents | After AI Agents |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Avg review time | 60 min | 12 min |
| Cost per contract | $350 | $85 |
| Monthly capacity | 200 contracts | 800 contracts |
| Attorney time on routine work | 65% | 20% |
| Annual cost (200 contracts/mo) | $840K | $204K |

**Annual savings: $636K** — 10x+ ROI on a typical engagement.

## How It Works

1. **Week 1:** We audit your contract types, clause library, and risk framework
2. **Week 2-3:** Deploy customized AI agents trained on YOUR playbook
3. **Week 4:** Go live with human-in-the-loop validation
4. **Ongoing:** We manage, monitor, and improve the agents — you focus on strategy
