MIT says 95% of AI projects never make it past pilot.

Not because the tech doesn't work. Because nobody planned for what happens after the demo.

We talked to dozens of mid-market companies last month. Same story every time:

→ Bought the AI tool
→ Ran a pilot
→ Got promising results
→ Then... nothing

The gap isn't intelligence. It's implementation.

Who owns the data pipeline? Who handles compliance when regulations change? Who monitors the agents at 2am when something breaks?

Most companies don't have answers to these questions. They have a Slack channel and a prayer.

That's why we built AfrexAI as a managed AI workforce — not another platform to learn, but agents that run your operations with governance built in.

NIST just launched their AI Agent Standards Initiative. The White House is backing it. Regulations are coming faster than most teams can adapt.

The companies that win won't be the ones who adopted AI first. They'll be the ones who deployed it properly.

If your AI project is stuck between "promising pilot" and "production reality" — that's exactly where we work.
