We talked to a compliance team last month that was spending 40+ hours per week on manual document review.

Not because they wanted to. Because their "AI solution" from 2024 kept hallucinating clause references.

So they went back to doing it by hand.

Here's what actually works (and what doesn't) when you deploy AI for compliance:

❌ Generic ChatGPT prompts → hallucinated citations, missed clauses
❌ "AI-powered" platforms that are really just keyword search → same false positives as before
❌ One-size-fits-all models → no understanding of your specific regulatory context

✅ Domain-trained agents that know YOUR compliance framework
✅ Human-in-the-loop validation on every flagged item
✅ Measurable accuracy benchmarks BEFORE going live

The firms getting real ROI from AI aren't the ones who bought the shiniest tool.

They're the ones who treated implementation as the product — not the software.

That 40-hour team? Down to 6 hours. Same accuracy. Zero hallucinations in production.

If your AI pilot "failed," it probably wasn't the AI. It was the implementation.
