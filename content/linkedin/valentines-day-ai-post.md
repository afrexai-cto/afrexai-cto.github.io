# LinkedIn Post — Valentine's Day Hook (Feb 14, 2026)

This Valentine's Day, let's talk about a relationship that's not working.

Your team and their repetitive tasks.

They didn't sign up to copy-paste data between systems for 3 hours a day. They didn't go to law school to review 400 contracts manually. They didn't get an MBA to reconcile invoices.

But here they are. And they're quietly looking for the exit.

The companies getting this right aren't replacing people with AI.

They're removing the work people never wanted in the first place.

One mid-market law firm we spoke with had associates spending 60% of billable time on document review. They deployed AI agents for first-pass analysis. Associates now spend that time on strategy and client work — the stuff they actually trained for.

Retention went up. Margins went up. Client satisfaction went up.

That's not automation. That's liberation.

If your best people are drowning in work a machine could handle, that's not a staffing problem.

It's a leadership problem.

Happy Valentine's Day. Go show your team some love. 💛
