## Post 1 — Monday: The Compliance AI Hook (Financial Services)

Every bank has a compliance team.
Most of them are drowning.

AML screening. KYC reviews. Suspicious activity reports. Regulatory filings.

All manual. All repetitive. All one mistake away from a seven-figure fine.

Here's what I keep hearing from compliance leaders:

"We're hiring more people to do the same work faster."

That's not a strategy. That's a treadmill.

AI agents can screen transactions against sanctions lists in real time. Flag anomalies that humans miss at 4pm on a Friday. Generate SAR narratives from structured data in minutes, not hours.

The banks adopting this now aren't replacing their compliance teams. They're giving them superpowers.

The ones that don't? They'll keep hiring. And keep falling behind.

If you lead compliance at a financial institution and want to see what this looks like in practice — DM me.

## Post 2 — Wednesday: The "AI Agents vs Chatbots" Clarification

Stop calling them chatbots.

A chatbot answers questions.
An AI agent does work.

Here's the difference:

Chatbot: "How do I file a prior auth?"
AI Agent: *files the prior auth, checks for errors, submits it, and flags the ones that need human review*

Chatbot: "What's our contract renewal date?"
AI Agent: *reviews the contract, identifies risky clauses, drafts a negotiation memo, and puts the renewal on your calendar*

95% of AI pilots fail because companies buy chatbots and expect agents.

We build the agents. They run 24/7. They integrate with your existing systems. And they actually do the work.

That's the difference between a demo and a deployment.

## Post 3 — Friday: The Law Firm Wake-Up Call

Law firms increased tech spending by 11% last year.

Most of it went to tools their associates never open.

Here's what actually moves the needle:

An AI agent that reviews 200 contracts overnight and flags the 12 with non-standard indemnification clauses.

An AI agent that drafts first-pass discovery responses in 3 hours instead of 3 days.

An AI agent that keeps timekeeping accurate without lawyers remembering to fill in their sheets at 11pm.

The firms winning right now aren't the ones spending the most on tech. They're the ones deploying AI that actually does billable work.

If you're a Managing Partner wondering where last year's tech budget went — let's talk about what this year's could actually deliver.
