95% of AI pilots fail.

Not because the tech doesn't work. Because companies treat AI like software — buy it, install it, hope for the best.

The 5% that succeed do three things differently:

1. They start with ONE workflow, not a "company-wide AI strategy." Contract review. Claims processing. Invoice matching. Pick one, prove ROI, expand.

2. They measure in dollars saved, not "AI maturity scores." If you can't put a number on it after 90 days, you picked the wrong problem.

3. They have humans managing the AI — not the other way around. Every agent we deploy has a human reviewing outputs until accuracy hits 99%+. Then it runs. Not before.

The gap between "we're exploring AI" and "AI saved us $2M last year" is execution, not technology.

Every enterprise has access to the same models. The difference is who implements them properly.
