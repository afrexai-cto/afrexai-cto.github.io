**To:** Brock Miller (find email via LinkedIn or Raymond James directory)
**Subject:** Quick question about your AML workflow costs

Brock,

I work with mid-market banks and financial institutions replacing legacy AML platforms with AI agents that actually work autonomously — not just fancy dashboards that still need 6 analysts behind them.

We've been tracking the WorkFusion space closely. With their pricing model and the Colorado AI Act deadline approaching, a lot of compliance teams are quietly evaluating alternatives.

Not sure if that's on your radar, but if it is: we built an ROI calculator specifically for BSA/AML teams comparing platform costs vs. agent-based automation. Takes 2 minutes, no strings.

Worth a look?
