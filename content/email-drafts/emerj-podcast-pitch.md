**Subject:** Guest Pitch: How AI Agents Are Replacing Compliance Teams (Not Chatbots)

---

Hi Emerj team,

I run AfrexAI — we build managed AI agent workforces for financial services firms. Not chatbots. Actual autonomous agents that handle KYC screening, AML monitoring, and regulatory reporting end-to-end.

I'd love to come on the show and talk about something your audience is dealing with right now: **the gap between AI pilots and AI that actually works in regulated environments.**

Here's what I could cover:

**Topic: "Why 95% of AI Pilots Fail in Financial Services — And What the 5% Do Differently"**

- Why compliance teams keep getting sold chatbots when they need autonomous agents
- The Colorado SB 24-205 deadline (June 30, 2026) and what it means for every fintech using ML in lending
- How one firm cut compliance review time from 11 minutes to 2 minutes without replacing a single person
- The "managed AI workforce" model vs. build-your-own vs. platform plays
- What Basel III.1 and SEC AI disclosure rules mean for AI adoption timelines

**Why me:**
- We've delivered $111K in pre-delivery revenue from a single client (VADIS) — proof the model works
- Deep technical background (I work with teams building AI agents daily)
- Can speak to both the business case AND the implementation reality
- Not selling a platform — we're practitioners, so the conversation stays practical

**Format flexibility:** Happy to do solo interview, panel, or debate format. I can bring specific numbers and case examples, not just theory.

Happy to jump on a quick call to discuss fit.
