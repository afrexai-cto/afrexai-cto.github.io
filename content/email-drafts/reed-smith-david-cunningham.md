# Cold Email Draft: David Cunningham — Reed Smith

**To:** David Cunningham, CIO, Reed Smith LLP
**From:** ksmolichki@afrexai.com
**Subject:** Quick question about Reed Smith's innovation programme

---

David,

I've been following Reed Smith's AI innovation work — particularly the focus on building internal capabilities rather than just buying off-the-shelf tools.

We build AI agent workforces for law firms. Not chatbots. Not "AI-powered search." Actual autonomous agents that handle document review, compliance monitoring, and client intake — the stuff that burns 40+ associate hours per week at most AmLaw 100 firms.

One of our legal clients cut their contract review cycle from 12 days to 3. Not by replacing lawyers — by giving them agents that handle the grunt work so they can focus on judgment calls.

Given the innovation programme you're running, I'd be curious whether Reed Smith has looked at agent-based automation for any of these workflows. Happy to share what we've built — no pitch, just a 15-minute walkthrough.

Best,
AfrexAI

**Notes:**
- Humanized: conversational, specific numbers, no AI-speak
- Angle: appeals to his innovation mandate, positions agents as different from typical legal AI
- CTA: low-commitment (15 min, "no pitch")
- DO NOT SEND without Kalin's approval — save as draft only
