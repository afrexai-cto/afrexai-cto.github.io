# Sean Ford Follow-Up — Monday Feb 24

**To:** Sean Ford (Skilled Real Estate, Miami)
**From:** cbeckford@afrexai.com (Christina Beckford, CEO)
**Subject:** Quick question about your real estate workflows

---

Hi Sean,

Hope you had a good weekend. I wanted to follow up on the note I sent Saturday about our managed AI agent service.

Quick question — what's the one workflow in your business that eats the most time right now? For most real estate operators we talk to, it's either lead qualification, listing coordination, or compliance paperwork.

We built a pilot program specifically for firms like yours: one AI agent, focused on your biggest bottleneck, live in 7 days. First month is $750 (normally $1,500/mo) so you can see results before committing.

No long contracts. No complex setup on your end. We handle everything.

Worth a 15-minute call this week?

Here's my calendar: https://calendly.com/cbeckford-afrexai/30min

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
