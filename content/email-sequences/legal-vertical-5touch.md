## Email 1 — Day 1: The Problem (Cold Open)

**Subject:** Your associates spend 40% of billable time on work AI could handle

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: how many hours per week do your associates spend on document review, contract comparison, and regulatory research?

For most mid-market firms we talk to, it's 30-40% of billable capacity — work that AI agents can handle in minutes, not hours.

We're AfrexAI. We deploy private AI agents inside law firms — not cloud tools that create data liability, but on-premise systems that stay behind your firewall.

One example: a compliance-heavy practice group cut document review time by 60% in 90 days. No data left their servers.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

## Email 2 — Day 4: The Risk Angle

**Subject:** Re: Your associates spend 40% of billable time on work AI could handle

{{first_name}},

Forgot to mention something that keeps coming up in our conversations with law firm leaders:

**The firms NOT adopting AI are losing associates to firms that are.**

It's not just efficiency. It's talent retention. Junior lawyers don't want to spend 60 hours a week on doc review when they know AI can do it. The firms that deploy smart automation become magnets for top talent.

And there's the competitive angle: when your competitor delivers a regulatory analysis in 2 hours instead of 2 days, clients notice.

We built our agents specifically for regulated environments — attorney-client privilege stays intact because nothing touches external servers.

Happy to share how other firms are approaching this.

## Email 3 — Day 9: The Proof

**Subject:** How a 40-attorney firm saved $280K/year with private AI agents

{{first_name}},

Real numbers from a mid-market firm deployment:

- **Document review:** 60% time reduction (contract comparison, due diligence)
- **Regulatory monitoring:** Real-time alerts vs. weekly manual checks
- **Client reporting:** Auto-generated status reports, freeing 8 hrs/week per partner
- **Annual savings:** ~$280K in recovered billable capacity

The deployment took 7 days to first working demo. Full rollout in 6 weeks.

Key point: this was a PRIVATE deployment. All data stayed on-premise. No cloud. No third-party access. Full compliance with client confidentiality obligations.

If you're evaluating AI options for {{company}}, I'd love to show you what "Week I Win" looks like for a legal practice.

## Email 4 — Day 15: Industry Insight

**Subject:** The ABA just changed the game on AI in legal practice

{{first_name}},

Not sure if you caught this: the ABA's latest formal opinion essentially creates a duty of technological competence around AI tools.

Translation: firms that DON'T evaluate AI for efficiency risk falling below the standard of care.

But here's the catch — most legal AI tools are cloud-based, which creates a NEW ethical problem around client data. Using ChatGPT on client matters? That's a confidentiality issue waiting to happen.

That's exactly why we built private AI agents. They run inside your infrastructure. Your data never leaves. You get the efficiency gains without the ethical exposure.

Would it make sense to have a quick call about how {{company}} is thinking about this?

## Email 5 — Day 21: The Breakup

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

{{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about AI agents for {{company}} — I know timing isn't always right.

If this isn't a priority right now, no worries at all. I'll close your file.

But if you're evaluating AI solutions for 2026 and want to see what a private, on-premise deployment looks like, I'm here.

Either way, here's a free resource: our AI Automation Playbook for professional services. No email gate, just useful: [link]

All the best,

## Personalization Notes

**Am Law 200 firms:** Emphasize competitive pressure, talent retention, and client expectations. Reference specific practice areas (M&A, IP, regulatory).

**Mid-market (50-200 attorneys):** Lead with cost savings and efficiency. These firms feel the squeeze most — competing with big firm resources on smaller budgets.

**Boutique/specialty firms:** Focus on the specific vertical (healthcare law, fintech regulation, environmental). Deep expertise + AI = unfair advantage.

**Compliance-heavy practices:** Regulatory monitoring is the strongest hook. Real-time alerts vs. manual tracking. The ABA competence angle hits harder here.
