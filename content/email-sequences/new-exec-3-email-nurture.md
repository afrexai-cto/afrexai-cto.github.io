## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)
**Subject lines (A/B test):**
- A: "90 days to prove AI works — here's how [Company] can"
- B: "Congrats on the [Title] role — one thought on your first AI win"

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Congrats on the [Title] role at [Company]. The first 6 months are when the board is watching closest — and AI results are what they want to see.

We work with [vertical] companies to deploy managed AI agents that show measurable ROI in 30-60 days. Not pilots that stall. Not chatbots. Working agents that cut costs, speed up processes, and generate revenue.

One quick example: a compliance team went from 3 days per client review to 4 hours using our agents. No new hires, no 6-month implementation.

Would a 15-minute call make sense? I can show you exactly what a first win looks like for [Company].

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 4)
**Subject:** "How [Similar Company/Vertical] cut [metric] by [X]%"

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up — thought this might be useful as you're building out your AI strategy at [Company].

We recently helped a [vertical] firm automate [specific process]. Results:
- [X]% reduction in processing time
- [Y] FTEs freed for higher-value work  
- ROI positive in [Z] days

The pattern we see with new [CIO/CDTO]s: the ones who bring in external AI agents for quick wins in the first 90 days build internal credibility 3x faster than those who try to build in-house first.

Happy to share our approach — no strings. Even if we're not the right fit, the framework is useful.

## Email 3: The Close (Day 9)
**Subject:** "Last thought on AI agents for [Company]"

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Last note — I know you're buried in the first months of the role.

Quick question: what's the one process at [Company] that everyone complains about but nobody has fixed? That's usually where we start.

We can run a no-cost assessment and show you what an AI agent would look like for that specific process. Takes 30 minutes, and you walk away with a concrete plan either way.

Here's my calendar if it's easier: [booking link]
