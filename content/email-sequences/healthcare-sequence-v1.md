## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your compliance team is doing work that should take 12 minutes, not 12 hours

**Body:**

Hi {first_name},

Saw your comments in HealthTech about {specific_ai_reference}. Sounds like you're already seeing what AI can do — but implementation bandwidth is the bottleneck.

We just helped a $2B financial services firm cut their compliance review time from 14 hours to 47 minutes per case. Not with a platform they need to learn. With AI agents that plug into their existing stack and run autonomously.

Health systems have the same problem: mountains of documentation, regulatory pressure, and staff who'd rather focus on patients than paperwork.

We build managed AI agents specifically for healthcare operations — clinical documentation, claims processing, prior auth. Fixed price, live demo in 7 days, and we guarantee measurable results in 90 days or you don't pay.

Worth a 15-minute call this week?

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 3, if no reply)

**Subject:** Re: compliance bottleneck — the math

**Body:**

{first_name},

Quick follow-up with actual numbers:

The average mid-market health system spends $2.1M/year on compliance staffing alone. Our clients typically see:

- 73% reduction in document processing time
- $400K-$800K annual labor cost savings
- Zero HIPAA violations from agent-processed workflows

We're not selling software you need to integrate. We deploy purpose-built AI agents that work alongside your existing team — no rip-and-replace, no 18-month implementation.

Our "Week I Win" guarantee: working demo on your actual workflows within 7 days of kickoff. If it doesn't impress your team, we walk away.

Happy to share a case study that's closer to your setup at {org_name}. Just reply "send it" and I'll drop it over.

## Email 3: The Angle (Day 7, if no reply)

**Subject:** Before your next board meeting

**Body:**

{first_name},

Board and C-suite pressure to "do something with AI" is real. But most health systems are stuck between:

A) Building internally (18+ months, $1M+ before any ROI)
B) Buying a platform (6-month implementation, another tool nobody uses)

There's a third option: managed AI agents. We handle the build, deployment, and ongoing optimization. You get results in weeks, not quarters.

Given {org_name}'s focus on {digital_transformation/patient_experience/operational_efficiency}, I think 15 minutes could save your team months of evaluation.

Here's my calendar: [link]

## Personalization Notes

### Jim Roeder (Lakewood Health System)
- {specific_ai_reference}: "evaluating AI for rural health operations"
- {org_name}: Lakewood Health System
- Angle: Rural systems can't afford 10-person AI teams. We're the equalizer.

### Michael Archuleta (Mt. San Rafael Hospital)
- {specific_ai_reference}: "AI radiology detection work with Radiology Partners"
- {org_name}: Mt. San Rafael Hospital
- Angle: You proved AI works for imaging — same ROI is waiting in documentation and claims.

### Connie Barrera (Jackson Health System)
- {specific_ai_reference}: "appointment workflow automation reducing no-shows"
- {org_name}: Jackson Health System
- Angle: You've already shipped AI wins. We help you scale that across more workflows.

### Crystal Broj (MUSC)
- {specific_ai_reference}: "digital transformation roadmap at MUSC"
- {org_name}: Medical University of South Carolina
- Angle: Academic health systems have the data and the vision — we bridge the implementation gap.
