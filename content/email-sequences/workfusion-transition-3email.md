## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your AML vendor just got acquired — what now?

Hi [First Name],

UiPath's acquisition of WorkFusion means your compliance automation stack is about to change — whether you planned for it or not.

Platform migrations in financial crime compliance aren't just expensive. They're risky. Regulatory deadlines don't pause for vendor transitions.

We've been helping banks and financial services firms build AI-powered compliance agents that aren't locked into any single platform. One client cut their sanctions screening review time by 85% in under 90 days.

If you're starting to think about contingency planning, I'd love to share what we're seeing from other WorkFusion customers navigating the same uncertainty.

20 minutes — worth it?

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Your AML vendor just got acquired — what now?

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up. Wanted to share something concrete.

A mid-size financial services firm came to us with a similar problem — over-reliance on a single compliance platform. In 6 weeks we deployed AI agents that:

- Auto-adjudicate 70% of sanctions alerts (the obvious false positives humans shouldn't waste time on)
- Generate impact assessments on demand for regulators
- Run continuous bias monitoring across lending decisions

Total cost? Under $200K for the first year. Their previous platform was north of $500K.

Happy to walk through the specifics if [Company]'s compliance team is exploring options.

## Email 3: The Deadline (Day 9)

**Subject:** Colorado + vendor transition = double deadline

Hi [First Name],

One more thought, then I'll get out of your inbox.

Colorado's AI Act enforcement starts June 30. If [Company] operates in Colorado (or serves Colorado customers), you'll need algorithmic discrimination protections and consumer disclosure systems — on top of your existing AML requirements.

Navigating a vendor transition AND a new regulatory deadline simultaneously is exactly the kind of thing that keeps compliance leaders up at night.

We built our AI agents specifically for this scenario: deploy fast, no platform lock-in, compliance-first by design.

If the timing isn't right, totally understand. But if you want a 20-minute sanity check on your options, I'm here.
