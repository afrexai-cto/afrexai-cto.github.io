## Email 1: The Opening (Day 0)
Subject: Your associates are doing $45/hr work at $350/hr

Hey {{first_name}},

Clients are starting to push back on contract review hours. You've probably seen it — RFPs now ask "what AI tools do you use?" and in-house teams are benchmarking turnaround times against firms that already automated.

Thomson Reuters just reported law firms increased tech spend 11% in 2025 — but most of that money went to tools that sit unused. Shelfware.

We take a different approach. We build AI agents that actually do the work — contract review, due diligence extraction, clause comparison — and we manage them so your team doesn't need to become AI experts.

One firm cut first-pass contract review from 14 hours to 90 minutes. Associates now spend time on analysis and client calls instead of redlining boilerplate.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits {{company}}?

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 3)
Subject: Re: Your associates are doing $45/hr work at $350/hr

Quick follow-up — wanted to share something specific.

Artificial Lawyer just reported that in 2026, corporate clients will demand AI-assisted contract drafting. The firms that aren't ready will lose work to firms that are.

Here's what our agents handle today. They do first-pass contract markup in under 2 hours instead of the usual 8-14 manually. They extract and categorize key terms across 500+ documents overnight for due diligence. And they flag deviations from your playbook automatically for clause comparison.

The kicker? We don't replace attorneys. We give them leverage. Your juniors become 3x more productive, your margins improve, and clients get faster turnaround.

We guarantee a working demo in 7 days — not a pitch deck, an actual agent working on your documents.

15 minutes this week?

## Email 3: The Risk (Day 7)
Subject: The firms that wait will pay more

{{first_name}},

Quick thought experiment: if your top competitor automates contract review this quarter, what happens to your win rate on RFPs by Q4?

Am Law profits per lawyer are up 53.7% since 2019. But that growth came from rate increases and leverage — not efficiency. Clients are getting wise. The next wave of growth belongs to firms that can do more work, faster, at better margins.

Every month you wait, associates spend 40%+ of billable time on reviewable work, clients compare your turnaround to AI-enabled competitors, and the best associates leave for firms giving them better tools.

We've built AI agents for regulated industries since day one. VADIS (our legal automation platform) was built for exactly this — $120K pre-delivery deposit from our first client because the ROI was that obvious.

Can I show you in 15 minutes?

## Email 4: The Breakup (Day 14)
Subject: Closing the loop

{{first_name}},

I'll keep this short — I've reached out a few times about AI-powered contract review for {{company}}.

If the timing isn't right, totally understand. But if contract review efficiency, associate leverage, or client turnaround speed is on your radar for 2026, I'd hate for you to miss what we've built.

Happy to reconnect whenever it makes sense. In the meantime, here's our AI automation playbook (free, no gate): https://afrexai-cto.github.io/ai-revenue-calculator/playbook.html

All the best,
