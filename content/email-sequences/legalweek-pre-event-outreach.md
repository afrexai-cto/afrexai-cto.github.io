## Email 1: Initial Outreach (Send Feb 17 — 3 weeks before)

**Subject:** Quick question before Legalweek

Hi [First Name],

Saw you're speaking at Legalweek — congrats. Your work on [specific topic/initiative] caught my attention.

Quick context: We build AI agents that actually work inside law firms. Not chatbots. Not "AI-powered search." Agents that do contract review, due diligence, and compliance screening autonomously — with a human in the loop where it matters.

One firm we're working with cut contract review time by 70% in the first month. Not a pilot. Production.

I'll be at Legalweek and would love 15 minutes to compare notes on what's actually working vs. what's still hype. No pitch — genuinely curious about your experience at [Firm].

Would [Tuesday or Wednesday] morning work for a coffee?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2: Follow-up (Send Feb 24 — if no reply)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question before Legalweek

Hi [First Name],

Know you're probably buried in prep. One thing that might be useful for your session:

We just published data showing 76% of enterprises want to buy AI capabilities rather than build them in-house. But most legal AI vendors are selling platforms, not outcomes. That gap is where firms are leaving money on the table.

Happy to share the full analysis if it's useful for your talk. Either way — hope to catch your session.

## Email 3: Day-of (Send March 9 — morning of Legalweek)

**Subject:** At Legalweek — grab a coffee?

Hi [First Name],

In town for Legalweek. If you have 10 minutes between sessions, I'd love to hear how [Firm] is thinking about AI agents for [contract review / due diligence / compliance].

I'll be near [location TBD] most of the day. Text me at [number] if easier.

**Monet Fauntleroy (Winston & Strawn):** Digital experience + innovation. Angle: "You're bridging the gap between client experience and internal operations. Our agents sit in that exact intersection."

**Shannon Capone Kirk (Ropes & Gray):** E-discovery + AI strategy. Angle: "E-discovery was the first wave. AI agents for transactional work is the second. You're positioned to lead both."
