## Email 1 — Day 1: The Burnout Problem

**Subject:** Your clinical staff are drowning in documentation

Hi {{first_name}},

Here's a number that probably won't surprise you: clinicians spend 2 hours on documentation for every 1 hour with patients.

And the downstream effects aren't just burnout — they're revenue leakage. Missed charges, coding errors, denied claims. For a system your size, that's typically $2-5M per year left on the table.

We're AfrexAI. We deploy private AI agents that handle clinical documentation, prior authorization, and claims processing — without patient data ever leaving your infrastructure.

One health system we worked with reduced prior auth processing from 45 minutes to 8 minutes per case. Denial rates dropped 34%.

Is that worth a 15-minute conversation?

## Email 2 — Day 4: The Compliance Angle

**Subject:** Re: Your clinical staff are drowning in documentation

Hi {{first_name}},

Forgot to mention something in my last note — the HIPAA angle.

Most "AI solutions" for healthcare are cloud-based. That means PHI going through third-party servers. Your compliance team hates it, and for good reason.

Our agents run on-premise or in your private cloud. No data leaves your environment. No BAA complications with yet another SaaS vendor.

We've deployed in HIPAA-regulated environments before. Happy to walk through our security architecture — it usually takes about 10 minutes and puts compliance officers at ease immediately.

## Email 3 — Day 8: Social Proof

**Subject:** How {{similar_org}} cut claim denials by 34%

Hi {{first_name}},

Thought you'd find this relevant — a mid-market health system (similar size to {{org_name}}) deployed our AI agents for claims processing last quarter:

- Prior auth time: 45 min → 8 min per case
- Claim denial rate: down 34%
- Staff reallocation: 3 FTEs moved from paperwork to patient-facing roles
- ROI: 5.2x in first 90 days

The kicker? Implementation took 3 weeks, not 3 months. No EHR replacement. Agents sit alongside Epic/Cerner and handle the grunt work.

Still open to a quick call?

## Email 4 — Day 14: Industry Insight

**Subject:** CMS just made AI documentation inevitable

Hi {{first_name}},

Not sure if you caught this — CMS is pushing harder on documentation quality metrics tied to reimbursement. The 2026 IPPS final rule tightens CDI requirements again.

For systems still doing manual CDI, the math is getting ugly. You need more coders to maintain quality, but there aren't enough qualified coders to hire. The AHIMA shortage data backs this up.

This is exactly where AI agents excel — consistent, accurate, tireless documentation support that actually improves over time.

We're seeing health systems move from "exploring AI" to "deploying AI" faster than any other industry right now. The ones who wait will be playing catch-up on reimbursement quality scores.

Happy to share what we're seeing across the market — no pitch, just intel.

## Email 5 — Day 21: The Breakup

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about AI-powered documentation and claims processing for {{org_name}}. Haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

Totally fine — I'll close your file for now.

If things change (new budget cycle, staffing crunch gets worse, board asks about AI strategy), my calendar's always open: [booking link]

All the best,
Christina

## Personalization Notes

### By Organization Type

**Hospital Systems (5-50 hospitals):**
- Lead with documentation burden + revenue leakage
- Mention Epic/Cerner compatibility
- Emphasize on-premise deployment for HIPAA
- ACV target: $200K-$500K

**Large Specialty Groups (50+ providers):**
- Lead with prior authorization bottleneck
- Specialty-specific examples (orthopedic auth delays, cardiology coding complexity)
- Faster decision cycle than hospital systems
- ACV target: $100K-$200K

**Healthcare BPOs / RCM Companies:**
- Lead with margin pressure + labor costs
- They're already tech-forward, speak their language
- Position as "10x your existing team" not "replace your team"
- ACV target: $150K-$350K

### Key Stats for Personalization
- 2 hours documentation per 1 hour patient care (AMA)
- 86% of physicians report burnout symptoms (Medscape 2025)
- $262B spent annually on billing/claims processing in US
- Average claim denial rate: 10-15% (up from 8% five years ago)
- Prior auth delays: 2 days average, 34% result in care abandonment
- AHIMA projects 30% coding workforce shortage by 2028
