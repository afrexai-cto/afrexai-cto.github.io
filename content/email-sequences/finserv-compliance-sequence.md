## Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)
**Subject:** 95% of AI pilots fail. Your compliance team doesn't have to.

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question — how many hours does your compliance team spend on manual KYC reviews each week?

At most financial firms we talk to, the answer is somewhere between "too many" and "we don't want to think about it."

Here's what caught my attention about {{company}}: with Basel III.1 deadlines tightening and AML requirements expanding, your team is probably stretched thin. And hiring more compliance analysts at $120K+ a head isn't exactly scalable.

We build managed AI workforces for financial services firms. Not another platform to figure out — actual working AI agents that handle document review, KYC screening, and regulatory reporting. One client cut compliance processing time by 73% in the first 90 days.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits {{company}}?

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: How Klarna saved $60M with AI agents

{{first_name}},

Didn't want to just throw claims around without backing them up.

Klarna deployed AI agents that now handle 2.3 million conversations per month. Results: resolution time dropped from 11 minutes to 2. $60M saved annually. Equivalent output of 700 full-time employees.

That's customer service. Compliance automation gets even better ROI because the cost per error is so much higher — one missed SAR filing can mean seven-figure fines.

We're not Klarna's vendor, but we build the same calibre of AI workforce, specifically tuned for financial compliance workflows:

- **KYC/AML screening** — 4x faster, fewer false positives
- **Regulatory change monitoring** — auto-flags relevant updates across jurisdictions
- **SAR/CTR preparation** — drafts filings, human reviews, submit

We guarantee measurable results in 90 days or you don't pay. That's our "$40K Recovery" promise.

Open to a quick chat next week?

## Email 3: The Angle (Day 7)
**Subject:** Your competitors are already doing this

{{first_name}},

I'll keep this short. Three things happening right now in financial services:

1. SEC's AI disclosure requirements are creating new compliance workload
2. Fintechs are using AI to process applications 10x faster than traditional firms
3. The firms that automate compliance first get a structural cost advantage that compounds every quarter

We work with mid-market financial firms ($500M-$5B revenue) to deploy AI compliance workforces. Not chatbots. Not dashboards. Actual agents that do the work.

If {{company}} is thinking about this for 2026, I'd love to share what we're seeing in the market. 15 minutes, no pitch — just intel.

If the timing's off, no worries at all. But this window won't stay open forever.

## Email 4: The Breakup (Day 14)
**Subject:** Closing the loop

{{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back — totally get it, compliance leaders have about 400 things competing for attention.

I'll leave you with this: every month without compliance automation costs the average mid-market firm $40K-$80K in manual processing that AI agents can handle. That's not a projection — it's what we measure in Week 1 of every engagement.

If this ever becomes a priority, my calendar's at afrexai.com. We're not going anywhere.

All the best,
Christina
