## Email 1 — The Clock (Day 0)

**Subject:** June 30 is closer than you think — Colorado AI compliance

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: has your team finished the impact assessment for SB 24-205?

The enforcement deadline is June 30. Every fintech using AI in lending, underwriting, or credit decisions needs algorithmic discrimination testing, consumer disclosure systems, and documented governance — all in place by then.

We've been helping financial services firms build compliant AI systems that actually improve performance (not just check boxes). One client reduced false-positive AML alerts by 40% while exceeding the new documentation requirements.

Would it be worth a 20-minute call to compare notes on your compliance roadmap?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — The Cost of Waiting (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: June 30 is closer than you think

Hi [First Name],

Didn't want to be that person who sends a "just following up" email. So instead, a data point:

The Colorado AG's office can request disclosure of your AI system documentation with 90 days' notice. That means they could start requesting as early as... now.

Companies that scramble at the last minute typically spend 3-4x more than those who plan ahead. And the fines for algorithmic discrimination aren't capped.

We built a free assessment that maps your current AI systems against SB 24-205 requirements in about 30 minutes. No commitment, you keep the output either way.

Worth a look?

## Email 3 — The Peer Pressure (Day 10)

**Subject:** What [competitor or peer company] is doing about AI compliance

Hi [First Name],

Interesting pattern we're seeing: the fintechs that are furthest ahead on SB 24-205 compliance are treating it as a competitive advantage, not a cost center.

They're using the required impact assessments to actually find bias in their models — and fixing it is improving approval rates by 8-15% without increasing risk. Turns out, fair AI is also better AI.

Three things the leaders are doing right now:
1. Mapping every AI touchpoint in their lending/underwriting flow
2. Building automated bias testing into their model pipeline
3. Creating consumer-facing explainability tools (required by the law, loved by customers)

We help with all three. 20 minutes to see if there's a fit?

## Email 4 — The Breakup (Day 18)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short. I've reached out a few times about Colorado AI compliance — sounds like the timing might not be right, and that's totally fine.

If SB 24-205 compliance bubbles up to the priority list before June, here's what we offer:

→ Free 30-min AI compliance assessment
→ Week I Win: working demo in 7 days
→ Fixed-price implementation (no overruns)

I'll leave the door open. Good luck with everything.

Christina
