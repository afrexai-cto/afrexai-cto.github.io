## Email 1: The Pain (Day 1)
**Subject:** Your associates spend 60% of their time on work clients won't pay for

Hi {{first_name}},

Most Am Law firms are sitting on the same problem — associates burning hours on doc review, contract comparison, and regulatory lookups that clients increasingly refuse to pay for at $400+/hour.

We built AI agents that handle that grunt work. Not a chatbot. Not a search tool. Actual autonomous agents that review contracts, flag risk clauses, track regulatory changes, and draft first-pass documents — while your associates focus on the strategy work that justifies premium rates.

One mid-size firm cut 23 hours/week of associate time on contract review alone. That's $47K/month back in billable capacity.

Would a 15-minute demo be worth your time this week?

Best,

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 4)
**Subject:** Re: Your associates spend 60% of their time on work clients won't pay for

{{first_name}} — quick follow-up with something concrete.

Three things our legal AI agents do that generic tools can't:

1. **Contract review in minutes, not hours** — trained on your clause library, flags deviations from your standards, not some generic template
2. **Regulatory change tracking** — monitors Federal Register, state bar updates, and industry-specific regs. Alerts your team before deadlines, not after
3. **First-draft generation** — engagement letters, NDAs, standard agreements. Your associates review and refine instead of starting from scratch

The firms using this aren't replacing lawyers. They're letting $600/hr partners focus on $600/hr work instead of $60/hr tasks.

We offer a 7-day proof of concept — your data, your workflows, measurable results before you commit anything. No risk.

Worth a conversation?

Best,
AfrexAI

## Email 3: The Breakup (Day 9)
**Subject:** closing the loop

{{first_name}} — I'll keep this short.

If automating contract review and compliance monitoring isn't a priority right now, no worries. But if associate burnout, rising costs, or client fee pressure is on your radar for 2026, we should talk before your competitors lock in their AI advantage.

Happy to reconnect whenever timing is better. Just reply to this email.

Best,
AfrexAI

## Notes
- All emails follow humanizer rules: no "leverage", no "streamline", contractions, varied sentence length
- Subject lines are lowercase/conversational — higher open rates in legal vertical
- Email 3 uses "breakup" pattern — often gets highest reply rate (15-20%)
- Personalize {{first_name}} and consider adding firm-specific detail (recent deal, practice area) for top targets
- IMPORTANT: These are DRAFTS. Do not send without Kalin's explicit approval.
