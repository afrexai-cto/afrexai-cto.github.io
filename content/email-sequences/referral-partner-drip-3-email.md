## Email 1: The Intro (Day 0)
Subject: We should probably be sending each other clients

Hi {{first_name}},

I run AfrexAI — we build managed AI workforces for mid-market companies. Financial services, legal, healthcare mostly.

I've been following {{their_company}}'s work in {{their_specialty}} and noticed something: your clients probably hit a wall where they need actual AI implementation, not just strategy decks. And our clients sometimes need {{their_specialty}} expertise we don't offer.

That's a pretty clean handoff in both directions.

We pay 15% revenue share for 12 months on any referred client. Our average deal is $200K-$350K, so that's $30K-$52K per referral. No exclusivity, no contracts — just good introductions.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to see if there's a fit?

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 4)
Subject: Re: We should probably be sending each other clients

{{first_name}} — wanted to share some quick numbers in case the first email got buried:

- Our clients see 3-5x ROI within 90 days
- Average engagement: $200K-$350K/year
- 95%+ client retention (they don't leave because the agents actually work)

The reason I reached out to {{their_company}} specifically: your client base in {{their_vertical}} overlaps perfectly with where our AI agents deliver the fastest results. Contract review, compliance screening, claims processing — the boring, high-volume stuff that eats your clients' margins.

I put together a one-pager on how our partner program works. Happy to send it over if you're interested.

Either way — no hard feelings. Just figured it was worth the ask.

## Email 3: The Breakup (Day 9)
Subject: closing the loop

Hey {{first_name}},

Last note from me on this — I know inboxes are brutal.

If partnering doesn't make sense right now, totally get it. But if you ever have a client asking about AI implementation and you'd rather hand it to someone who actually delivers (instead of another vendor selling vaporware), we're here.

Talk soon or never — either's fine.
