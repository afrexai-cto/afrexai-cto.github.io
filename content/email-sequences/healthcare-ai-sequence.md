## Email 1 — The Burnout Problem (Day 1)

Subject: Your clinicians spend 49% of their day on paperwork

Hi {{first_name}},

Nurses at {{company}} probably didn't get into healthcare to fill out forms. But that's what they're doing — nearly half their shift, according to AMA data.

We've built AI agents that handle clinical documentation, prior auth, and claims processing. Not a platform you need to learn. Actual working agents that plug into your existing EHR workflow.

One health system we worked with cut documentation time by 62% in the first 90 days. Their nurses said it felt like getting two hours of their shift back.

If that sounds worth 15 minutes, I'd love to show you how it works.

## Email 2 — The Cost Angle (Day 4)

Subject: $1.3M in denied claims — recoverable?

{{first_name}},

The average 500-bed hospital loses $1.3M annually to preventable claim denials. Most of those denials come down to documentation gaps and coding errors — exactly the kind of repetitive pattern-matching that AI agents handle better than tired humans at 2am.

Our claims processing agent catches denial-prone submissions before they go out. One client reduced denials by 34% in the first quarter.

Worth a conversation?

## Email 3 — Social Proof (Day 9)

Subject: How {{similar_company}} saved 4,200 staff hours

{{first_name}},

Quick stat: Klarna replaced 700 FTEs of customer service work with AI agents. Saved $60M in year one. Resolution time dropped from 11 minutes to 2.

Healthcare is catching up. CMS is pushing value-based care harder every year, and the systems that automate their back office fastest will have the biggest margin advantage.

We help health systems deploy AI agents for clinical documentation (both ambient and structured), prior authorization automation, claims scrubbing before submission, and patient intake and scheduling.

No 18-month implementation. First agents live in 2 weeks.

Open to a quick call next week?

## Email 4 — Breakup (Day 14)

Subject: Last one from me

{{first_name}},

I know your inbox is a warzone, so I'll keep this short.

If AI-powered clinical operations isn't on your radar right now, no worries. But if it is — or if staffing costs keep climbing — here's a free resource:

AI Automation Playbook for Healthcare Operations (link to playbook)

It covers the 5 highest-ROI use cases for AI agents in health systems, with real numbers.

Either way, wishing {{company}} a strong Q2.
