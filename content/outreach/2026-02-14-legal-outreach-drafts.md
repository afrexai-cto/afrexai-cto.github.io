## 1. Ilona Logvinova — Chief AI Officer, HSF Kramer

**Subject:** Building AI strategy from scratch? Skip the consulting phase.

Hi Ilona,

Congrats on the CAO role — building AI strategy for a newly combined global firm is no small mandate.

I'm reaching out because we work specifically with firms navigating the "we need AI but can't use public tools" gap. Private agents, your infrastructure, zero data leakage, ABA 512 compliant.

One example: a contract review workflow that went from 40 hours/week to 4 — without a single document leaving the firm's environment.

Given you're building from scratch at HSF Kramer, you're in the rare position to skip the "pilot 12 tools and waste a year" phase entirely. Happy to share what's working at firms your size.

Worth a 20-minute call next week?

## 2. Greg Lambert — Chief Innovation Officer, Jackson Walker

**Subject:** New CINO role + AI implementation — quick thought

Hi Greg,

Saw you stepped into the CINO role at Jackson Walker last August. The fact that the firm created the position signals serious commitment to legal tech — not just talk.

We build private AI agents for law firms — the kind that run inside your infrastructure, never touch client data externally, and actually handle the grunt work (contract review, due diligence triage, document drafting).

Most firms we talk to have banned ChatGPT but know they need AI. We bridge that gap.

Given you're building your innovation strategy from the ground up, I'd love to share what's working at similar-sized firms. No pitch deck — just patterns and numbers.

20 minutes next week?

## 3. Maureen Naughton — CIIO, Lowenstein Sandler

**Subject:** AI for VC/tech-focused firms — different playbook

Hi Maureen,

Lowenstein's VC and tech practice gives you a unique angle — your attorneys already understand AI's value from advising the companies building it. The question is making it work internally without the risks.

We deploy private AI agents (your infrastructure, zero data retention, fully auditable) for firms that need more than Copilot but less than a full R&D team.

Contract review, due diligence, and document drafting are the obvious wins — but the firms seeing the biggest ROI are the ones automating intake and client onboarding too.

Would love to compare notes on what you're building. 20 minutes?
