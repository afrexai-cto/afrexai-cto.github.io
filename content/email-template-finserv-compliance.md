Version A (Pain-led):

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: how many hours does your team spend on SAR narratives each month?

Most mid-market banks we talk to say 200-400 hours. One of our clients got that to 80.

We build managed AI agents specifically for compliance teams — KYC screening, AML alert triage, SAR narrative drafting, regulatory change monitoring. Not a platform you have to configure. Working agents, managed by us, integrated into your existing workflow.

The "glass box" approach — every AI decision traces back to specific data and logic. Your examiners can see exactly why a flag was raised or cleared.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits [BANK]'s compliance roadmap?

Version B (Results-led):

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Basel III.1 deadlines are tightening, AML scrutiny is up, and most compliance teams I talk to are stretched thin.

We help mid-market banks automate the grunt work — SAR narratives, KYC reviews, transaction monitoring alerts — with AI agents that actually explain their reasoning. Not black boxes.

One compliance team went from 12-hour SAR cycles to under 3 hours. Their examiners loved it because every decision was traceable.

Could I show you a quick demo of how it works? 15 minutes, no slides.

Personalization notes:
Always reference a specific regulation affecting their bank. If they spoke at a conference or published an article, lead with that. Mention their bank by name in the subject line (Version B). Forbes article hook: "Precision, not hype" — quote it if prospect seems skeptical.
