# ACAMS Speaking Proposal — AfrexAI

## Session Title
**"Beyond RPA: How AI Agents Are Replacing Legacy AML Platforms (And What Your Team Needs to Know)"**

## Abstract (200 words)
The AML compliance landscape is shifting. Legacy platforms like WorkFusion and Actimize promised automation but delivered rigid, expensive systems that require armies of consultants to maintain. Meanwhile, a new category — AI agents — is emerging that can actually think, adapt, and act on compliance workflows autonomously.

This session explores the practical reality of deploying AI agents in financial services compliance: what works, what doesn't, and what the Colorado AI Act means for your current vendor stack. Drawing from real implementation experience with mid-market banks and financial institutions, we'll cover:

- Why 70% of RPA implementations fail to deliver promised ROI
- The difference between "AI-powered" marketing and actual autonomous agents
- A framework for evaluating when to replace vs. augment your current AML tools
- Regulatory readiness: how the Colorado AI Act changes vendor selection criteria
- Real cost comparisons: legacy platform licensing vs. AI agent deployments

Attendees will leave with a practical evaluation checklist and ROI calculator they can apply to their own compliance operations immediately.
