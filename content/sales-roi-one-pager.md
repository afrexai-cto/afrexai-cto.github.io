## Proof Points to Use in Calls
- "$111K committed pre-delivery by our first enterprise client"
- "Working agents in 7 days, not 7 months"
- "JPMorgan deployed compliance AI agents — if they need it, you need it"
- "Bretton AI just raised $75M for AI compliance. The market is moving."
- "68% of healthcare orgs deployed agentic AI. How many are audit-ready?"
- "CSI Survey: AI is now the #1 priority for community banks, surpassing cybersecurity"

## Objection Handling

**"We're already using ChatGPT/Copilot"**
→ "Those are copilots — they help individuals. We deploy agents that run workflows end-to-end. Microsoft's own Copilot just exposed confidential legal emails. Individual tools ≠ governed operations."

**"We don't have the budget"**
→ "Our single-agent plan is $1,500/mo — less than a part-time intern. And it works 24/7. The question isn't budget, it's what's the cost of NOT having governance when the audit comes?"

**"We want to build in-house"**
→ "You can. It takes 6-12 months and a dedicated AI team. Or we can have agents running your actual workflows in 7 days. Most clients start with us, then bring capabilities in-house once they see what works."

**"How is this different from [competitor]?"**
→ "Most AI vendors sell you a platform and wish you luck. We deploy, govern, and operate the agents. You get outcomes, not another tool to manage."
