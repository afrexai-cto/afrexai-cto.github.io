# Cold Email — Healthcare CIO (HHS Deadline Angle)
*Draft: 2026-02-18 | For ksmolichki@afrexai.com → healthcare CIO targets*

## Email 1 — The Deadline (Day 0)

**Subject:** April 3 is 44 days away — [First Name]

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: does [Organization] have working AI agents in production, or just an AI governance framework on paper?

The HHS mandate (April 3) requires all divisions to adopt AI governance practices — bias mitigation, outcome monitoring, security, human oversight.

The catch: you can't govern AI you haven't deployed.

We've been helping health systems get AI agents into clinical documentation and claims processing in 30 days — with full audit trails, monitoring, and human-in-the-loop controls baked in.

Governance becomes a checkbox when the AI is already built right.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits what [Organization] is working on?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI

## Email 2 — The Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: April 3 is 44 days away

[First Name],

One data point: hospitals deploying managed AI agents are seeing 25% reduction in clinician documentation time and 30% fewer readmissions for remote patient programs.

The ones still in "pilot mode" are burning budget on governance frameworks with nothing underneath them.

We built a quick assessment that shows exactly where AI agents would have the highest ROI in your workflows — takes 10 minutes, no commitment.

Would that be useful?

Christina

## Email 3 — The Break-Up (Day 9)

**Subject:** closing the loop

[First Name],

I'll keep this short — I know CIO inboxes are brutal.

If AI governance for April 3 is handled, great. If it's still a question mark, we can get working AI agents deployed in 30 days with full compliance baked in.

Either way, happy to be a resource if the timing is better later.

Christina
