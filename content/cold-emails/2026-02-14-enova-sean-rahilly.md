**Subject:** SB 24-205 + $67B in ML lending decisions

Sean,

Colorado SB 24-205 takes effect June 30. Every ML-underwritten lending decision becomes a "consequential decision" requiring impact assessments, bias audits, and consumer notification protocols.

With $67B+ in ML-originated loans, Enova's exposure is significant. Most lending platforms we've spoken with are discovering the gap between their current model governance and what the law actually requires — particularly around adverse action explanations for algorithmic decisions.

We build AI agent workforces that automate compliance workflows — impact assessments, bias monitoring, audit trails — without adding headcount. One client saved $2M/year replacing manual compliance reviews.

Worth a 15-minute call to compare notes on how you're approaching June 30?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
