**Subject:** AI agents for insurance ops — quick win for your first 90 days

Hi Bradley,

Congrats on the CIO role at CSAA — exciting time to lead technology at an insurer this size.

New CIOs in insurance tell us the same thing: the board wants AI results fast, but compliance and legacy systems make it hard to move quickly.

That's exactly the problem we solve. We deploy managed AI agents — not chatbots, not copilots — actual working agents that handle claims processing, underwriting support, and compliance documentation. Our clients typically see 60-80% time reduction on repetitive workflows within 30 days.

One example: an insurance compliance team automated KYC/AML screening from 3 days per client to under 4 hours. No new headcount, no 6-month build.

Would a 15-minute call be worth it? I can show you what a first quick win looks like specifically for a P&C insurer like CSAA.

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
