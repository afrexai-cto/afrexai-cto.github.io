## Email Draft

**Subject:** Homebot + Colorado SB 24-205 — you're in scope

Charlie,

Since Homebot is Denver-based and uses AI to recommend financial decisions to homeowners, you're squarely in scope for Colorado SB 24-205 (effective June 30).

The law requires impact assessments, bias audits, and consumer disclosure for any AI making "consequential decisions" — which includes recommendations about home equity, refinancing, and property transactions.

Most teams your size don't have spare compliance bandwidth to build this from scratch. We deploy AI agent workforces that handle impact assessments, bias monitoring, and audit documentation automatically. Think of it as a compliance team that scales with your product, not your headcount.

Would it make sense to chat for 15 minutes about what June 30 actually requires?

Best,
Christina Beckford
CEO, AfrexAI
