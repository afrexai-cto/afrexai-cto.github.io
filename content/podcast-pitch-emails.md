## 1. Compliance Into the Weeds (Tom Fox)

**Subject:** Guest pitch: Why compliance teams are losing the AI race (and how to fix it)

Hi Tom,

Love what you've been doing with Compliance Into the Weeds — especially the recent episodes on AI governance gaps.

I'm Christina Beckford, CEO of AfrexAI. We build AI agents specifically for compliance teams — not chatbots, actual autonomous systems that handle SAR filing, policy monitoring, and regulatory change tracking.

Here's what I'd bring to your audience:

**Topic: "The $4.3M Compliance Gap — Why AI Tools Fail Without Implementation"**

- 87% of compliance teams buy AI tools but never fully deploy them (we see this constantly)
- The real bottleneck isn't technology — it's the 6-12 month implementation cycle
- How "Week I Win" delivery (working demo in 7 days) changes the economics
- Real numbers: one client recovered $40K in manual labor costs in 90 days

I can share war stories from finserv, legal, and healthcare compliance deployments — no fluff, just what actually works.

Happy to jump on a 15-min pre-call if helpful.

## 2. The RegTech Pulse (Encompass / LSEG)

**Subject:** Guest idea: Private AI agents vs. SaaS — the compliance deployment debate

Hi team,

Been listening to The RegTech Pulse for a while — great balance of regulatory substance and practical tech insight.

I'd love to contribute an episode on a topic that's heating up fast: **why compliance teams are moving from cloud SaaS to private, on-premise AI agents.**

Quick context: I'm Christina Beckford, CEO of AfrexAI. We deploy private AI agents for regulated industries — financial services, legal, healthcare. The key differentiator: everything runs inside the client's infrastructure. No data leaves the building.

**What I'd cover:**
- The regulatory push toward data sovereignty (EU AI Act, state privacy laws)
- Why "private AI" isn't a marketing term — it's becoming a compliance requirement
- The implementation gap: firms spending $500K on AI tools they can't deploy
- Case patterns from mid-market banks, insurance firms, and law firms

This resonates particularly well with your audience given the cross-border compliance angle.

Would love to chat about fit.

## 3. Barefoot Innovation (Jo Ann Barefoot)

**Subject:** The implementation crisis in compliance AI — guest pitch

Jo Ann,

Your work bridging regulation and innovation has been a north star for us at AfrexAI. The episode on responsible AI adoption in banking especially resonated.

I'm Christina Beckford — we build and deploy private AI agents for compliance teams at mid-market financial firms. Not another dashboard or SaaS tool. Actual autonomous agents that file SARs, monitor policy changes, and flag regulatory gaps.

**Proposed topic: "From $500K Shelfware to $40K Recovery — Making Compliance AI Actually Work"**

The thesis: The compliance AI market is flooded with tools nobody uses. The real value isn't in the model — it's in the implementation. We've seen firms:
- Buy $200K+ platforms that sit idle for 18 months
- Lose more to manual processes than the tool would've saved
- Finally deploy in 7 days with the right implementation partner

I can bring real deployment data, failure patterns we've seen across 50+ prospect conversations, and a frank take on what's working vs. what's hype.

Happy to send a one-pager or do a quick intro call.

CEO, AfrexAI
